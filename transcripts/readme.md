# Lecture Transcripts

This repository folder contains the speech-to-text transcripts of the lectures delivered in-class by **Prof. Michele Giugliano** during the **2025/26** academic year. It is of course an experiment as these transcripts should not be considered as a booklet.

## 📄 Available Formats

1.  **PDF Files:** This folder contains two PDF files that consolidate the entire series of transcripts. 
    * *Note on Language:* Since the first 12 hours of the course were taught in English, the initial sections of both PDFs are identical.
2.  **Markdown Files (`.md`):** Each lecture is available as an individual Markdown file (both in Italian - see the IT/ folder, and in English - see the EN/ folder).
    * *Conversion:* The `.md` files can be easily exported to Microsoft Word, PDF, HTML, or LaTeX using the open-source software [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/). Zettlr includes a distribution of [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org), simplifying the conversion process for users without specialized technical backgrounds.

## 🛠 Methodology and Technical Transparency

These transcripts are produced on the Professor's personal initiative and for educational purposes only, sadly without any financial or technical support from our University. The production workflow was as follows:

1.  **Speech-to-Text (STT):** The original audio was processed via the **Whisper** model (Meta) to convert speech into raw text.
2.  **LLM Refinement:** The raw text was then processed by **Gemini** (Google), using the Professor's own paid subscription, to correct grammatical errors, punctuation, and syntax, as well as to organize the text into logical paragraphs and sections.

### The Prompt Used
To ensure content fidelity and prevent AI-driven distortions or unwanted summarization, the prompt used for obtaining the refined transcript is provided in the "prompt" folder.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer and Pedagogical Considerations

**Accuracy and Correctness:** These transcripts are provided **without any guarantee of completeness or accuracy**. They are intended solely as a supplementary aid for individual study, while a student is watching the videorecorded videos, and do not replace class attendance or the study of recommended textbooks.

**The Importance of Personal Synthesis:** While research suggests benefits for students with learning disabilities (*Engen Matre & Lansing Cameron, 2022 - doi: 10.1080/17483107.2022.2149865*) and for visual-auditory reinforcement, passive use of transcripts can be counterproductive. 

The Professor wishes to emphasize that:
* Over-reliance on pre-compiled texts can slow down the cognitive processes associated with **critical re-elaboration**.
* The ability to **synthesize essential elements in real-time** and the practice of **manual note-taking** remain fundamental academic and professional competencies.
