# Class 1 Transcript

### **Part 1: Course Logistics and Introduction**

#### **Section 1: Opening Remarks and Course Language**

Okay. Thank you. Even without a microphone, without this microphone, is it okay?

Since I'm recording, I don't know the effect of this Bluetooth microphone on the amplification device. If, however, at a certain point, my voice is going to decrease for physiological reasons, I'm going to show you and I'm going to put the microphone on.

For vice-versa, I'll give it a couple of minutes because I don't know if all of your colleagues are already here. You are perhaps less than the total number, someone is missing. Do you know if someone is not here?

Anyway.

Hello everyone, I'm Michele Giugliano. The G is redundant. You will learn this because I'm obsessed with the fact that people write it correctly. Also because on Google, otherwise, there are 25,000 results if you want to have contact or search for me.

The intention would be to do the course in English. I'm not Shakespeare, you'll hear it. It's an opportunity, if most of you agree, to offer something more. Most of the courses in bioengineering and in general, in master's degrees, in *laureate*, in Italy, are in English. You can acquire passive English. I don't ask... if you have questions or comments, you can do it in English. You can do it in English. For an exam, idem. I will give you more details in a few minutes. You can do it in English. In English, all the world is in English. You can be exposed for free, not to a native speaker, *non a un madrelingua*, but to someone who learned it and chewed it up on the road, *a qualcuno che l'ha imparato e l'ha masticato sulla strada*, and you simply get more practice. You have the recordings of the lectures, maybe I will even provide the audio myself, I can provide you with the transcript, so the speech-to-text. And then you can, if at a certain point my pronunciation changes from London Cockney to Edinburgh, becomes Scottish, maybe you can give me a sign and tell me you didn't understand. We have to be together every week from now until mid-December, it will be tough, with this slog of four hours of non-stop lectures. So you can absolutely interrupt me and say, "I didn't understand, can you explain it again?"

If you agree, I'll switch to English. A technical English is not so different. Not only does the world revolve and function in English—the scientific literature is in English, the textbooks are in English—you have a quantity today in your pocket, you have all the knowledge, the PDFs of any article, you don't have to go to a library to make photocopies, and it's all in English. You have a huge amount of tutorials, of videos on YouTube, besides videos of kittens and other various nonsense, but it's all in English. Bombard yourselves, if you can, with English. It's an extra professional skill. You can have it, or not, and you could be better than your colleagues who don't have it. And it's not rocket science.

Okay, I switched to English.

So welcome. I am the coordinator of this course and I'm teaching you this module, which is called "Electrophysiological Signals." In general, please come to me if you have problems with any other module, particularly at the end when you have to take all the exams for each module. If you have any problems or if you have any advice or criticism on how we can improve the entire course, please speak up.

#### **Section 2: Attendance, Communication, and Course Materials**

So I'm going to track attendance. Please download, if you don't have it already, the app. I don't do it for controlling you; I do it for my own sake to understand whether it's true, like in the past few years, that after the first couple of classes people got scared and they stopped. No, I'm joking, they did not stop attending, but I would love to see whether also in terms of timing, in terms of schedule, this is doable for you. So at every class, I will give a different code. Today it is **9PSTK**. You put it in the app and basically, it's tracking your attendance. And I think if you send it to a colleague of yours who is not here, it will not work. Please. No problem, I don't care. It's just roughly for statistics. The same thing happened last year, so for attendance tracking, I don't care. For me, it's just roughly the case.

What I do care about, but not for controlling you, just to offer you a communication channel, is Teams. So if some of you are not yet registered, let me know. If you can join in a moment... I'll give you... I'll change the slide in 30 seconds. There is a QR code for you to join the Teams, and in principle, via Teams, we can chat. You all should constitute some sort of mini-community. You should help each other if you have questions about the content of the class and in general the content of the course. You're more than welcome to post your questions and try to help each other, but in general, you can reach me via instant messaging. So... And those who are not yet registered officially might have troubles. So if you do not have a unimore.it email address, please contact me, send me an email with your, say, Gmail account, and I will add you manually in the meantime.

So this is the QR code to join Teams. I think most of you, if not all, were on Teams. And you can do it in two ways. One is by the QR code; it should bring you directly to the Teams of the course, of this module. Well, sorry, no, it's of the entire course, but it's probably only me using it. And then otherwise, if you have already Teams installed, you can join the room, join the chat, the group, the team with that code. All of this, you have on the overhead, which I will post up front before the start of each class. It could be the day before, it could be maybe two days before, it might be five minutes before. So you will have the slides, so don't worry. You don't necessarily have to write down everything, because you are going to have the slides. And the slides are not posted on Teams, although I might say, "Hey, I posted..." We have a website for this module, which is... I'm coming to that in a moment. So if you're not a Unimore student yet, send me an email—remember the extra G, otherwise you don't find me on the internet—and you send me your, say, Gmail account, whatever, your email, because that is needed for me to add you to Teams. Please.

You Google it. You're digital natives, you should be able to search "Michele Giuliano Unimore"—it should be me. Give it a try if you don't. The only thing you have to remember that unfortunately is I am redundant. There is an extra G. So I will show you in a moment.

We have a course website, and we have a GitHub repository. Does any of you know what GitHub is and what a repository on GitHub is? It's a website where people can store files. So if I want to give you something, I put the PDF of my presentations there. Or if I want to share code, I can do it and I do it there. And everybody will, if the repository is free, be able to download the files. In the technical environment, in the technical professional sector, sometimes not only geeks but also people involved in software development, but also nowadays hardware, also in open source, also in open science, it is becoming permanent to have a GitHub account. It's your portfolio. So you're encouraged to create your own GitHub account profile. And if, whatever, if some of the courses at this university are suggesting you or requiring you to do a mini-project, for instance, you can put the code or the electronic schematics or the chemical solution, whatever, as well as your report, if you want to publish it to the world, on the GitHub repository. You can put your GitHub repository, your GitHub username account on your CV. Nowadays people are curious; not only do they find the email of almost anyone, but they can kind of see, "Okay, who is this guy or this lady? What did he or she do?" So having a web presence might be professionally something cool.

I don't remember whether this QR code is pointing to that website, which is posted on GitHub pages, or on this. So github.com is the site where you might want to be curious. It's owned by Microsoft. It has been acquired recently, and it's free for students. With your student email, you can get some sort of free account that allows you to have unlimited public or private repositories. So you can even have your private stuff there. And the website looks like this, so it's a boring website where you have several tabs. One is with just a few lines on aims, what you hope to get from this module. There is a schedule; it's almost every, every, every week on Tuesday. We still don't know the room, the logistics for the other days. I will post it as soon as I have this information. What else is on this website? There is the exact content of all the topics at the end of the semester. You may want to check on this list because this list is what I will have in front of me while asking you questions. But more on the exam later. Now I scared you with this, you say, "Oh my god, you will ask me about the definition of mobility of an ion in solution." I could, but it's a trivial thing, it's a conventional thing, as we will see possibly next week.

Not only the content, and by the way, there is some sort of chapter 0, which I'm not covering. It's about mathematics: differential equations, calculus, basically. So, derivatives, integrals. It's very brief, it's a series of brief videos amounting to, I don't remember whether it's two or three hours. Use this material, it's a refresher if you need it. I'm not a mathematician, I'm an engineer, but sometimes we will use the language of mathematics. I don't know whether you're fond of or familiar with Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize winner, a very famous physicist. He basically said, "Sorry, but nature speaks the language of mathematics." If you want to understand how nature speaks, and since we are talking about biological systems, well, you have to, and it's a natural system, you need to use the language of math. Possibly your background, I will ask you in maybe 10 minutes to tell me in 30 seconds who you are. Maybe your background is all in engineering; you should not be particularly scared about mathematics. There, anyway, you have material to support you. And at any point, even if it's something really stupid, like "Sorry, I don't remember algebra," come to me and ask questions. I prefer, maybe during class or in the breaks, or later during office hours, that you come to me and maybe I can help you by giving an explanation. And you can maybe catch up and finally remember algebra, instead of carrying over the problem for several weeks or months and having issues with maybe otherwise mathematical parts of the course.

Not only the content, you also have resources. So here it's something where I will put some stuff: PDFs, links to videos, links to papers from the literature. I cannot post PDFs of books, of course, as you know, and I invite you never to look at pirate websites because on these websites, being illegal, you can find almost any book. And if you want to quickly have a look at some book, you should not go on these illegal websites. So this is also a place where I posted some links to tutorials, say about programming in Python, or maybe you are or are not familiar with using computers with a keyboard, with the so-called command-line interface, instead of with a mouse and a graphical user interface. We will not use it, but if you want, there are some links here. And there are also some videos that I will show you today about examples of electrophysiological signals. But the most interesting part are these two links. If you click on either of them, you are brought to the GitHub website where you see it's a sort of file system. Here you have files, here you have notebooks (and I will tell you what notebooks are), and here you have the overheads. And this is the slide that I posted yesterday and then updated a couple of hours ago to add some stuff. Okay, so this is very convenient. You do not need necessarily to reach GitHub; you can reach the website. What else is there? I think that's it. So here, Teams, I'll disable it. Before it was thought to be on Discord, but I will disable this. There is no Discord group anymore.

The Spirit, and here you might see some rambling on why online, regardless of the fact that I'm there also in the same team, but you should be a decent person, you should not harass your colleagues, and my hope is that maybe, depending on how shy or extroverted you are, maybe you can help each other. Maybe someone has a question about, "Well, I did not understand what the guy meant with this mobility of ions in a solution, did you understand it?" "Yes, look, I explained it to myself..."—I'm just thinking of a colleague of yours who might answer—"I explained it to myself as a person, as a body swimming in the sea and finding friction." If you don't talk in real life, maybe try to talk in your digital life. But try to talk, and particularly talk to me if possible. So this is the website. And the website is also reachable from Teams, which has a crappy interface, but at the top, there is a tab that I added where if you go on that tab, you go to the website. And the mathematical preliminaries and the handouts, so the slides, as well as the notebooks, are posted there.

#### **Section 3: Practical Work and Prerequisites**

Notebooks are, for those of you who know what this is, but I invite you to have a look at a YouTube video in a moment, it's a sort of practice involving Python. But this is not a class on scientific computing, so I don't necessarily want you to become proficient in Python. I will show you something and we'll do it with Google Colab, so you don't have to install anything on your computer and you use Google's free cloud computing time. If you want to install something on your laptop and you have troubles because you're not a computer scientist—neither am I—but you can come to me and say, "Look, I have troubles, I can't manage." I'm not an IT guy but I'm happy to help. In other universities, in the room, there would be like two or three people, sort of teaching assistants, who will be there to say, "Let me, I will do it for you, I will help you." We don't have that, it's just me. And don't be shy, you can hopefully count on me.

So this is about the mathematical refresher. I suppose, I assume you don't need it, but it covers very basic things like what a mathematical function is, what a plot is, what does it mean if you take a mathematical function and you add something or subtract a quantity—maybe the graph is going to shift vertically, horizontally, etc. And some notable functions like straight lines, exponentials, logarithms, blah blah. Derivatives, they will be very useful, and integrals will also be very useful, both definite and indefinite. As I said, I'm not a mathematician; this is not a course in mathematics. There was something on the blackboard from a previous class that was geometry. Although we are in the Institute of Pure Mathematics, I'm not in love with mathematics to that extent. And then there are other things you might not have seen. Well, you should, being engineers. Those of you who are engineers should be familiar with the Dirac delta function, typically used in linear systems to probe the response to a pulse, and the convolution integral. Again, it's something that you might have heard about, maybe people call it filtering, but it's the same thing. And again, differential equations—only one differential equation, what I will call over and over the only, boring, typical, usual differential equation that I would love you to get acquainted with, and it's this one. Say this is a function of time; it's this one, maybe plus something. This first-order differential equation, the coefficients are constant, and I don't ask you whether you remember what the solution is. I only invite you to refresh your knowledge, not mnemonically, but just by understanding it and reading aloud what it is. It says: what is the function *f*—since differential equations are equations where the unknown is not a number like in an algebraic equation, but it's a function, so it's a collection of... well, it's a rule, it's a mapping, it's not only a collection of numbers—what is this function that when you take its derivative you get the function itself? There are also some memes on the internet where there is a function that no matter if you differentiate it, it just stays the same. Only geeks... do you remember which function this is? It's the only function that is worth... yeah, I like the exponential. Exponential, yeah, indeed. I thought you said logarithm, `ln(x)`. No, it's the exponential, perfect. So you don't need it, but we'll see even during some parts of the course where I'm going to derive some mathematical formulas, I'm not going to assume that you are very skilled or at ease with mathematics, hopefully.

So there is no guarantee... I thought that maybe that stuff over there was a camera, but it's not a camera, so I brought my own cameras and I'm trying to record with my own microphones. Hopefully, it will work. Sometimes there might be some glitches, so there is no guarantee, but after... so I'm not streaming, I'm recording, and at the end... let me check that I'm recording because otherwise... yeah, I am... otherwise, it will be disastrous. And maybe the day after, a couple of days later, depending on when I can upload the file to YouTube, you will find it on this channel. There will be a playlist with the name of the course. But again, I hope so. Last year, nothing happened. You never know, the computer, the battery, everything can go wrong. Sometimes I might forget to... well, in this case, it will not happen because I changed the setup, but say I might... you will only see my face and not the slides. You do have the slides, so it's not the end of the world. And maybe you don't see my face, and okay, fine, you can survive not seeing my face.

#### **Section 4: Class Structure, Exams, and My Teaching Philosophy**

Okay, practicalities. Classes are in person, slides, and chalk. I hope they are interactive, really, I mean it. I don't give a damn if you ask a stupid question. I don't care. I forget. I really don't care. I will not remember at the exam, saying, "This person..." No, I honestly don't care. I have other things on my mind and I cannot read yours... I cannot read your mind. So I have some experience from many years of teaching, so I can see whether you are completely blanking and you're brain-dead. Right now, maybe a little bit scared, but not yet. So if you don't speak, I cannot help. I cannot try again, being clearer, explaining myself in a different way. So I ask you to be interactive. And of course, it will be boring if I have to talk for four hours straight, although there will be breaks, don't worry. And I will propose there are some alternatives for breaks depending on what you... what you do. So I don't mind stupid questions. And again, if you need help, maybe you're shy to ask in front of your colleagues. It's normal, everybody, to some degree, is shy. You can contact me. And even if you have some problems with whatever... okay, not your personal problems hopefully, but if you have interests or if you are passionate about something or if you realize that you don't know about something else, ask. I'm happy to help. In principle, that's my main job: to transfer knowledge. And so if you want information about some topic or even in general about bioengineering or about neuroscience or about neuroengineering, come to me.

So handouts, I told you, they are made available to you upfront. Videotaping, hopefully. For all of you in the class, if the slides were the only things required to pass the exams, then I would basically be better off staying at home, and you probably as well. So I'm going to add more stuff, and you can stop me. And I'm not, say, super intelligent or super knowledgeable, but I know a little bit and I can tell it to you, and particularly by reacting to your questions, there might be way more stuff than what's on the slides.

So the hands-on, there will be some practical parts just to make your life a little bit more interesting, hopefully. It doesn't need to be... I mean, you can listen to this stuff completely passively. Again, you don't need to install anything on your computer. I would maybe suggest those of you who are really interested to do that, and it's about installing, for instance, Python and some distribution of Jupyter. I don't know whether you know what this is, but otherwise, if you don't and you only want to use a web browser because you only have, say, a tablet and you don't want to bother, you can use a website which is hosted by Google and it's free to some extent. It's called Colab. And of course here I don't have any notebook to show you. It's some sort of web interface where you can use their computers to crunch numbers, to plot functions, to plot data. And you also can mix text, code, which is not around, which I don't see the code here. Okay, here it's code, whatever it is. I'm not particularly familiar or fond of Python, but okay, so this is Python code and this is a plot. So on the same document you have text, explanations, annotations, code, and the result of this code. This is becoming a common practice in general in science where people are not only giving you the data—so a few years ago they were not even giving you the data. "Here is the paper, study the paper, trust the authors for the results." No, today, hoping to have reproducible science and research, we give you not only the data that we acquired, say in an experiment—say plugging myself into some electrodes in a moment, although it will not work—and then not only give you the data, I give you the code that I use to analyze the data and I put it on the same page, really for dummies. For dummies in the sense that it doesn't require people to install stuff on their machines and hopefully it will possibly be reproducible. A few years ago, there was this image of the black hole that was reconstructed by means of algorithmic means. Probably you all remember this sort of donut, it's a sort of *ciambella*, it's red with a hole in it. And that was the first image of a black hole. They gave the data and they gave what they call notebooks, so this thing, to people together with their publications. This is what the hands-on parts are, and these notebooks are already posted, all of them. If you want to be curious and you want to sneak a peek, they are on the GitHub repository in the folder called "notebooks." And again, for prerequisites about math, coding, and particularly biology, which I suspect you might not be ultra-strong in, ask. There is some material for the next, not necessarily for the next week but in general for the next couple of weeks, that I posted. It is on the GitHub repository and you'll also find the links. It's some reading material that you may or may not read. It's not something that I will ask at the exam, but it's something that you will need if you feel weak in terms of biology, neurobiology in particular. So on these slides, I gave you the link to that YouTube video from a guy, a blond guy if I remember, that in like two or three minutes explains what Google Colab is, what notebooks are. And this was the solution that I... so the alternative... so if you are in between, if you're not completely scared by computers and so you use that, and if you're not a computer geek that you install your own distribution of Python using Anaconda or virtual environments with UV or pip or whatever, then this is intermediate. And it was a standalone application that you could download on your computer to have, on your computer, your machine, the same thing that's over there in the cloud. It was called JupyterLab Desktop, and a few months ago they stopped developing it. So it still works, but I don't know for how long. You may give it a try. When you download it, it downloads Python inside itself. And so you have Python on your computer encapsulated, wrapped inside this software. This is because installing Python may not be entirely trivial, particularly if you have, say, a Mac or if you're on Windows where there are also another series of complications. If you are using Linux then you probably are sleeping now because you're supposed to be more expert about installing stuff.

So the exam for this module is an oral interview, informal. I don't like quizzes, I don't like written tests, because I'm not there to help you. If you go blank because you're getting emotional, you don't remember things, I'm not there to see, "Okay, okay, good, I want to help." And maybe you need just a bit of information just to restart. It happens all the time, it happened to me as well. I hated particularly the closed-answer questionnaires. This is humiliating to me. You have to be given time, 20 minutes, half an hour, that I'm sitting there and I listen to you while you recreate on a blackboard in detail what I do or present to you during the class. And the overall... I will show you the statistics in a moment, although it's based only on last year, but it's still something that you might be interested to know. So the final score is the score of individual modules, and it's weighted by the credits, by the CFU. So depending on how many credits, the score, the mark that you get in one module, has a bigger weight. *Cum laude* means that you have to get 32 out of 30 in total, although in my module I gave several *cum laude* last year. And we round to the closest integer. So we don't look at the ceiling, the integer that is approximating by excess or by defect by floor. We just use the closest integer. And it requires, you cannot skip any module, and you're supposed to complete the entire thing in 24 months, in two years, which is reasonable. So for the moment, since it's basically the start of the second year, we don't know, there are only two or three people out of 20, if I remember correctly, who did not complete all the modules. They are missing mine or another one, I don't recall.

So statistics from the past. So that's the average mark. So I think that you can lower your anxiety, particularly because I was told that you are quite smart. I don't know, other lecturers had a good impression and I'm curious to interact with you, just to learn from you. So you see I'm not particularly strict and all the people were good. And one out of three got *cum laude* because they were interested, not because I gave it as a gift to them. And overall, across all the modules of this entire big course, you see the final mark was not particularly low. And so this might lower your anxiety.

Exams and exam sessions. I think I will have six sessions of exams in January-February. I did not manage to add them yet on the ugly online platform called ESSE3, which is very crappy, but that's the only thing. And I will ask you to register with great advance, maybe during the month of December you decide when you want to take your exam, my part, just my part. And you see there are 12 slots a day and there are... 14 from 8:00 in the morning until 1:00 p.m., one after the other. It takes the time that it takes. Unless you're really abusing the time, I will stop you. So if we go 40 minutes instead of... so I will try to be fair, so that all people get 20-25 minutes. So I will try to be fair in that respect. I cannot add sessions in June or July yet, but you will see it's plenty of opportunities. And exceptionally, you can contact me and we can schedule one appointment on a day that you want if this is fulfilling some sort of need. I would love to avoid having this as a rule because otherwise, you will say, "Okay, maybe today, maybe tomorrow, what do you do tomorrow? Can I do the exam?" and maybe you don't show up. If you register, if you contact me, then you must show up. I will not fail you if you don't show up, but as I'm going to help you, you help me not blocking time.

Now for the... I know that you finish the previous class at 1 p.m., so you have only one hour for lunch. My preference is to start at 2 p.m. sharp and finish a little bit earlier—well, 50 minutes earlier, but better than nothing. But it's your call. The alternative would be that we can even start at the famous academic quarter of an hour or even at 2:30. Of course, we would then exceed because I need the amount of hours. And the idea is you can think of it, you don't have to... we don't have to decide. Well, today we started around 2:05, and you tell me what's your preference. Maybe make a poll, make a Doodle, do whatever, and let me know.

Breaks. Normally I do, because I'm used to it... I taught for 11 years in Belgium to students of several curricula, but they were not bioengineers like you are. And they were a bit intimidated and they were going blank after a while. So the style was that I was stopping, like I'm planning to do today, every 45-50 minutes for a 10-minute break. A 10-15 minute break. We will do three of these breaks. Maybe you have a stronger stamina, I don't know. There are alternatives. We could only stop after one hour. Probably I cannot do four hours in a row, but a couple of hours I can do. I can do it, particularly if I get... you will see some topics will get me excited and I hope that I can at least pass this enthusiasm to you, or at least that you learn, "Okay, this topic is cool but I don't care and I don't want to do this in life." Fine. For me, it would be a success to tell you what you might or might not be good at, or might not be passionate about. So that's another possibility, that we only do one break. For the moment we have another 10 minutes to go and then if you want, we'll break. Otherwise, you let me know. When the timer rings you will tell me whether you want me to continue for another, say, 45 minutes or you want to stop.

### **Part 2: Instructor and Student Introductions**

#### **Section 1: About Me, Your Instructor**

So I'll tell you a little bit about myself. I'm an electronic engineer by training. At the time I studied in Genoa, I started in 1992, which seems like a really long time ago, and there was no bioengineering, there was no biomedical engineering, but there was already some sort of specialization that was biomedical engineering, and this was what I took. I'm very proud that I did not take some classic exams as engineers do, like economics and construction science, because I didn't care, and I wanted to study biology. I wanted to study some topics that I chose. At that moment it was bioelectromagnetism, and there was another one that was bioelectronics. I wanted to do that. That seemed to be the future. And indeed, that's the case. But it's me. That was me. Then I continued with a PhD, a doctorate in Genoa, well in reality it was in Milan, but it was under the supervision of a pioneer of bioengineering and neuroengineering in Italy, the late Massimo Grattarola. And I basically did a PhD in bioengineering and it was basically about computational neuroscience, which is a discipline related to using models and computers to study the brain. And then I left Italy. That was a very good decision. And I regret that I'm back, but that's another story.

So I did my first postdoc, which in the academic trajectory is what you do, you continue doing research. And I did it in an institute of physiology at the Faculty of Medicine in Switzerland, in Bern, at the University of Bern. To joke, I say that I was looking for the best chocolate. In Genoa, although it's not Liguria, there is this Novi Ligure chocolate, which is still my favorite, but I wanted to try other things. So Switzerland was a clear step to take, so I did that. And then after a few years, I moved to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, the EPFL in Lausanne, which is a terrific place. I was a group leader and both during my postdoc and my second postdoc I was doing experiments myself, doing electrophysiological experiments. So that's why I'm here to tell you about electrophysiological signals. And I'm particularly interested in cells, not the entire thing. So I will try to show you something, but it will not work, of course, but I'm more intrigued by the mechanism, in the same way that transistors in this device are sort of microscopic units that determine the computational features, the properties of the device. Then I moved to Belgium, so the other step for chocolate is Liguria, which is Novi Ligure, it's not in Liguria, but anyway, so Switzerland, then Belgium, although Belgian chocolate, I don't know whether you know it, it's a bit complex. It's not plain good or bad, it's with stuff inside. It was not my thing, but I stayed there 11 years, 10-11 years, and I was a professor of neuroscience. And then I came in 2019, just in time for the pandemic and for the lockdown, as a professor of physiology at SISSA, that is like Scuola Superiore di Pisa. It's special, it's only a PhD, research-intensive institution. And in 2024, I joined Modena because they wanted to, and they did, start bioengineering, and as you know, there was no bioengineering before. So I basically... this is my trajectory.

And as I said, I'm intrigued by the mechanisms, particularly of cells and nerve cells that we will have ample time to talk about and to discuss. They are electrical devices, and to me, it blew my mind as a student, more or less... maybe I was one year younger than what you are now, to learn from a professor that not only were they electrical devices, they were sort of generating signals very fast. This is one millisecond, and on the y-axis... it's a picture from an oscilloscope in the old times. You were not able to record the data with an analog-to-digital converter like this one that is now very small and conveniently attached to a USB cable. At that time you were taking a picture on either a paper recorder or an oscilloscope. So very brief, one millisecond, and about 100 millivolts. That's the amplitude of a nerve impulse. And 100 millivolts is 0.1 volts, and it's not so different from what the internal voltages of a microprocessor are. Maybe you're familiar with your power plug which is 5 volts, or you maybe know if you play with electronics that some stuff is powered by 3.6, 3.3 volts, whatever. Modern microprocessors have internal voltages that are even smaller. And there you eat a banana or chocolate and you fire that. You don't need a small nuclear plant like ChatGPT does. So this blew my mind, and the other thing that blew my mind was that it was possible to write equations. And it was, for me, amazing. How could you study biology with mathematics and physics and chemistry? Well, after all, it is physics, chemistry, and mathematics, so it may not be surprising, but to write an equation that maybe can describe the electrical activity of neurons, maybe one neuron or a network of neurons, really inspired me a lot. And so that's why I basically got into this field, with the dream of understanding how the brain works—of course, this is still a dream—and to make some sort of difference or to sort of bring some positive things in, say for patients, for patients with neurological disorders.

And again, I'm intrigued by cells. These cells that you see here have been filled with a dye. They are from the cortex of a human, but no students were sacrificed at that stage. It was from a patient, and they are called pyramidal cells. They are called pyramidal cells because their soma resembles a pyramid, and you see a lot of cables. Nerve cells are cables; they have a lot of wires, and this is impressive. And when you look at this, you will not see exactly this image under a microscope with living tissue. It's remarkable how dense this network is. And if you open an electronic device, maybe you should try at some point to break something and open it, because nowadays the printed circuit boards are very complicated. You will see that there are a lot of cables, a lot of leads, a lot of contacts. And one of the famous, well, the most famous neuroanatomist that studied these cells was at the end of the last century, or sorry, at the beginning of the last century, around 1901, 1905. He was from Spain. His name was Ramón y Cajal, and he looked at this and he understood and he got it right, that these things are kind of fetching inputs from there, and something that you don't see here, there is another fiber that is bringing signals out, and that's the output. And the guy, just by looking at these images, understood the function, well, understood some features of the function, which is remarkable. But the reason why I thought of telling you about this is because he called them the "butterflies of the mind," of the brain. And indeed, they are beautiful, as opposed, say, to sperm cells that are the example of minimalism. They have nothing, it's just a cell body and a tail to swim. These guys are baroque, they are so complicated and they reminded him of trees. So particularly all of this branching and bifurcations, like trees. Unfortunately, we don't have windows to look outside; there are trees. Next, as you go out, have a look at trees. In that case, trees are bifurcating, are branching, probably to fetch light, to expand the surface to fetch light. Over there, maybe these cells are expanding to fetch inputs. And over there, it's the top where my hair is, so it's called layer one, or the pia mater, which is one of the dura and pia mater. It would be what is immediately below the bone, below the scalp. And what you have here is the white matter, which is kind of in my ventral part. And so somehow this guy is having this sort of fiber which is called a dendrite, from the Greek word for tree, *albero*, *dendros*, and then it's kind of towards the top, it's bifurcating, it's branching to fetch inputs.

What do we want to do? We stop or we continue? For me, it's the same. Just don't be shy, I'm fine whatever you say. Who wants to stop? So let's stop. So we come back in 10 minutes. Thank you.

#### **Section 2: My Research and Student Introductions**

So, I lead a laboratory, an experimental laboratory, that you're welcome to visit if you're interested, upon appointment in the coming months or even next year, whenever you want. And we do three things, we combine three disciplines. One is experimental neurophysiology. So we want to study *logos*, the physiology, the functioning of nerve cells, or the electrical function of nerve cells, and we do it experimentally. And then we also use mathematical models and physics and computers to make sense of the data that we record, as well as to make new experiments that involve a computer. We do hybrid circuits where some part is a biological neuron, some biological cells, and some part is simulated cells. And I also work at the interface with neurotechnologies, so nanomaterials or non-conventional tools such as optogenetics. Did any of you hear about optogenetics? I will tell you what it is. In a few years, I'm pretty sure they will give a Nobel Prize to these two people, two American scientists. They invented a way to make a protein that normally real neurons do not express—well, they express it in the retina in some cells of the retina—and you shine light with a laser beam... I do have it, this... well, it's not really a laser beam... hello, yeah... so you shine light with a laser beam literally and non-invasively you are able to excite or inhibit the electrical activity of a cell. Imagine that you are suffering from seizures, we will probably discuss it later today, and you have a seizure that means a very sudden, highly synchronized electrical activity in your brain. In principle, I could shine light with a fiber optic and I could switch it off. It's not yet reality but they will get the Nobel Prize. So today we don't use it for therapeutic reasons, we don't put it in the faulty retina of blind patients to restore... well, somebody does and they were successful in restoring vision, but we use it as a way to probe cells and circuits and networks because we can interrogate by stimulating or inhibiting just in a non-invasive way. Imagine literally I can have a laser beam and I can move it to different positions, so I can excite this neuron here and I can maybe inhibit this neuron there, but I will tell you in due time, I will tell you more.

Now you tell me... okay, first, before asking you to tell me about yourself in 30 seconds, in my free time, when I have free time, I'm a geek and I'm particularly intrigued by radio transmissions. And I... it's now a few years that I'm trying to learn... it's a stupid thing because you never heard of it, but it's all pedagogically thought out, so you will see that it makes sense. One of the reasons is that I'm fascinated because the way neurons encode information is clearly not by a man-made code, but they do it in a way that seems to depend on the frequency of this nerve impulse. Now I have no idea whether in the cars, say of your parents or your own car, you still have something that is called a radio. When I was younger and even today I have a radio and the radio had two bands, so it's not only podcasts and not only Bluetooth connection to a device, but you could literally hear radio transmissions from a radio DJ or whatever. And it's FM instead of AM. Have you ever heard of this? So AM, maybe those engineers among you who studied electrical communication, they might even have studied the nitty-gritty of it. So with amplitude modulation, the carrier, which I won't tell you what it is, is modulated by the information content by changing its amplitude. Now for a nerve impulse, it seems this is not the case. All the nerve impulses have this 100 millivolt, 0.1 volt amplitude, but what changes is the frequency, like in FM. And in fact, you know that AM is sort of noisy, sloppy. I don't know whether you ever... if you have a radio, try to put it on AM and you will hear a lot of noise. Instead FM, when you are on the right frequency, the quality of the sound is very nice. So encoding information in frequency is more robust in terms of signal-to-noise ratio. And maybe this is not a surprise that my foot is controlled by some neurons in my motor cortex by frequency modulation. And instead in my retina, where the distances are very, very tiny, very small, neurons also communicate by amplitude modulation. It's not really the nerve impulses and other things, but this is very interesting. That's why I'm a geek, because I take things from work home and vice versa. Maybe it can be of interest.

Each of you, I would love to hear for 10 seconds who you are, what is your background. Some of you already told me that they are not engineers and I'm fine, actually I'm very happy that there is diversity. I hope that the engineers among you will help those who are biologists or physiologists and vice versa, the physiologists could help the engineers who might be ignorant in other things. And why bioengineering? That would be very interesting. And if you don't know why, that's fine. I did not know for a while what to do in life, for many years, even during university, and so that's fine. And if you want, what do you do in your free time, if you do sports or whatever. So please, let's start like this, otherwise you will... you will have a start. I don't care, even if you can do it in Italian, in English, whatever, feel free.

Thank you. I can't. Thank you. Chocolate? No, just kidding, just kidding. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Thanks everyone, I really appreciate it, you're a tough crowd. So I hope to work well with you and that you can find interesting ideas in what I tell you.

### **Part 3: Study Materials and Course Structure**

#### **Section 1: Recommended Reading**

Okay, so as study material, there is one book that covers most of the topics. Of course, it does it in a very structured way, not necessarily in the way that I will follow, but it's the first one. And I think I ordered... well I think, I'm pretty sure I ordered at least two copies last year and they are available in the libraries. Do not attempt to find it on PDF on illegal websites, but sometimes some of the books are good to have, and so that one is a nice book. It is authored by a series of researchers, particularly one from Norway. And of course, I forgot the name of... Okay, it will come to me. So he's a pioneer, the last author of that book. Gaute Einevoll is a pioneer on some of the techniques that we will also discuss later on, the extracellular signals in the brain.

There are other books that you can look at. So these are classic books for... and again, I wrote chapters, so it doesn't... I don't mean from chapter 1 to chapter 20, and some of the books are really, really... it's a sort of Bible. So this is the Bible of cell biology. It's really a tiny big book and it has a lot of details. Same as Kandel, Schwartz, and it has now other authors, possibly it's not 2012, but it's *Principles of Neuroscience*. It's again a Bible and it's only for references. This is a light introduction to neuroscience and the first four chapters might be useful for those of you who are not necessarily that familiar with the biological aspects. And *From Neuron to Brain* by Nicholls et al., 1996, is about... it's a two-volume book and it's about biophysics. Again, not the entire book would be required, but you will find the content of the classes over there.

There are a few things, a few readings that are available on GitHub as well as linked on the website as PDFs. So one is just a few pages... for those of you, probably you don't use it anymore and it's not a thing anymore. When I was a student in high school, there was a company called Bignami and they were making very tiny booklets for Latin or history or philosophy, whatever. So this is a sort of Bignami. So it's very condensed and it's an immensely incomplete summary, but in two pages, it tells you what a neuron is, what a synapse is, what a receptor is. You might want to just have it, to use it, and I think it's just maybe two or four pages, if I remember correctly. This is more blah blah, it's not even aimed at students, it's for the general public on brain facts, and it's an introduction on the... a little bit on the working of the brain, particularly the early parts that are not dealing with behavior. Of course, you can read it, you can read all of it, but for the topics of the course, only the first couple of chapters are relevant. And then there is also the entire PDF, because it was put in the public domain by one of the Nobel Prize winners of several years ago, I think it was in the 60s, Hubel. Have you ever heard of Hubel and Wiesel? I will show you later what they did. So this guy wrote a very tiny book, very high level, very, say, science communication, so it's not a technical book, called *Eye, Brain, and Vision*, and it tells about the part of the brain that we understand the most. And for me, as a student, it was a very nice primer, a very nice introduction to the neurobiological concepts that came up over and over again. So you might find it relevant. You don't have to study it. I'm not going to ask about material from these things. They are readings for you. You should be selfish. You should study for yourself, not for the exam. And as you could see, the exam at the end is not going to be impossible to pass. You should now try to study for your own professional life, not as a strategy to pass the exam. There is no point if you study just to pass the exam; in a matter of a couple of weeks after, you will forget everything. If not, if you study for yourself, maybe you will learn and remember things for your lifetime.

#### **Section 2: Practical Data and Demonstrations**

So, what I will also do, because the demo that I would like to attempt now in the next 10 minutes will not work for a series of reasons. The last one is that I had the bad idea to rehearse it last night. And as those who have experience with electronics, they know the term "magic smoke." "Magic smoke" is what happens at some point when something burns and you see smoke coming up out of electronic circuits. And so I don't think it will work. And there are other reasons that I will tell you why it will not work. But you have data on the GitHub pages, as well as you have a notebook that I will invite you to play with. "Play" means you load it into Python, you plot it, and maybe then it's up to you. You can do the Fast Fourier Transform to get rhythms in these traces, although they are crappy traces. It's something that I recorded last year. And another thing that you could say, being an electrocardiogram, there are peaks. It was my electrocardiogram from last year. Maybe you could find a way to count how many peaks there are, but we will see that later. So, you even have a YouTube tutorial that will sort of illustrate this notebook. This is not compulsory. I encourage you to do it. Again, if you don't do it, I don't care, but it has been done just to pique your curiosity. But let me skip this for the moment. Where is the demo? I want to do the demo now. But okay, first I have to talk about frogs, otherwise I cannot say whether I am like a frog or not. Okay, so maybe we do, say in 10-15 minutes we'll break, and then we'll do the demo later on.

The demo has a little bit of a component of risk, that's why I'm not asking any volunteer to be plugged in, because in principle, and maybe I will ask for your help in the future, everything could be working with a battery, because I could disconnect the power supply of the computer, and the computer now is standalone. But the computer, unfortunately, because of the video projector, is attached to this HDMI cable, and that one is a source of potential risk, because the ground of this cable, the reference electrode of this cable could be floating, so I could electrocute myself. I hope it doesn't happen, but I don't want to electrocute you. It would be one bioengineer less, so it could be less competition, but it will not be fair to do this at the university. And this may not electrocute me, but it will create a lot of noise. You will see how bad noise is. So, I'll talk about signals that I'm going to show you, maybe, or maybe not. And I'll talk about noise.

I ask you, what is a signal? What is a biological signal? You have the slide, so you can read what the slide says. Do you have any suggestions? Some of you have been already exposed to signals. I don't remember who, but you told me that you did data and signals. So you should be familiar with this definition, a rigorous definition of signals that maybe you will see again, you have seen it in the last couple of days, from my colleagues. But I would love to set the topic on what is a signal. What do you think is a signal? What could that be? Thank you. Perfect. And this series of data points, maybe they could be in time, assuming that my heart beats, and at some point now and half a second later, and half a second later, I might record a different kind of distribution of electrical potential. Or it might be a set of numbers that are changing in space like an image, like an fMRI—well, fMRI would be in time as well—let's say like an MRI scan. There will be an image, it's a collection of... it's a bi-dimensional collection of numbers. In every coordinate (x,y) you will have one number, for instance, like this image. So that's correct, thank you. So it's a physical variable, it's an observable perhaps related to a biological system that is subject to some sort of variation. Otherwise, it would be boring, it would be just a value, it would be 26. 26 what? 26 millivolts maybe, or let's say minus 70 millivolts that will come over and over. It will be boring if it's always minus 70 millivolts. If it changes over time, that might be interesting. Maybe you're alive or maybe you're dead. At least I can tell whether you're dead or alive. So variations in time or in space. And it can be represented analytically by some formula, a mathematical function, but it does not need to be. The story of introducing or reminding you of the concept of the function is because a function is a really interesting mapping for mathematics that says from this value of the input, the independent variable, you have only one number in a scalar function. So at this moment in time, the temperature here is probably 22 degrees, only one. And so the independent variables could be one or more; if it's the plane of an image it could be x and y, if it's time it's one. And if the function is not scalar but it's a vector function, maybe at this moment in time I'm getting the oxygen concentration, the temperature, and the heartbeats. So it might be multiple, might have multiple dimensions. Something that... all concepts... this has been discussed in mathematics 1000 years ago, so they were useful even before inventing any device to measure these signals.

These are known functions, mathematical analytical functions like the exponential or a sinusoid. By the way, if time is measured in seconds, what is the frequency of the sinusoid? You know? Or the period? I wrote it in this way because for many years at the university people told me about sinusoids, sine and cosine. Okay, but if I want the sine of 20 Hertz, how do I write it? So T is in seconds and you probably know that inside this function, things have to be without physical dimensions. Well okay, yeah, pi is in radians but it's not really a physical dimension. So here inside, a physical unit cannot survive. It cannot be time. I don't know what the sine of 23 seconds is. It's like an exponential of three apples—it doesn't make sense. I don't know. So this 0.1 is the value of the frequency, it's 0.1 Hertz, which is 100... so it's one... so it's 10 milliseconds... so sorry, 100 milliseconds. Anyway, this collection of data points might also be collected in a file on a disk or on paper or on an oscilloscope. It does not require to be described analytically by a mathematical function. And so these are some examples of scalar functions, like electromyography, that maybe is the only thing that will work. I will try to see whether I can get electrical activity in this muscle. Music, so a voice recorded, now it only has one channel, it's not right or left, it's not stereo, so at every moment in time I'm basically sending via Bluetooth just one number that is the intensity of the sound. A black and white photo is another scalar example of a signal because you have two independent variables, but for each x and y you have one value that is the brightness, the gray level. If it's black and white, it is only one level. And there are other examples. So if it's a vector function, it might be some sort of observable of a fly that is moving around, and at every moment in time, I can measure the instantaneous velocity. And the instantaneous velocity might be a vector, talking about some direction, some intensity, and some *verso*. So, some direction and intensity. So, it's vectors, you know, that might be described by three numbers in a Cartesian system. So, for every moment in time, I have three numbers. That's the meaning of a vector, sorry, a vector signal.

#### **Section 3: The Historical Roots of Electrophysiology**

Now for the specific case of electrophysiological signals, it's very interesting and intriguing. I don't know whether you have watched this silly little talk that I gave a few years ago at a science festival. We owe it to... so the entire field of electronic engineering, of electricity, of electromagnetism is actually due to people who embarked on measuring electrical phenomena in biological systems, which I find surprising. And probably you know that these two guys, two Italians, were considered the fathers, the pioneers, and particularly Galvani was the one that just by chance found that there must have been some sort of "animal electricity," because when he touched the nerve of a resected leg of a frog with a metal, then the frog's muscle contracted. So it seems to be... well, it must be some electricity. Now Galvani, unfortunately, got it wrong in one interpretation because he thought that it's a fluid, it's the animal fluid. It's not the same phenomenon that Alessandro Volta, they were more or less contemporaries, was studying in a different lab. He said, "No, this has nothing to do with metaphysics or with some animal principle." It's the exact same electricity that this guy, Volta, got by, inspired by Galvani, placing different metals together. It's the same electricity. And so, but they were anyway giants, despite this rivalry and despite the... yeah, despite that Galvani got it wrong. And he actually died in bad conditions, depressed and convinced that he was, he had been a failure. He was not. So this is a stupid movie to show that by sort of closing the circuit and applying some sort of electricity or metal, the leg of the frog was indeed contracting. And these are the starting observations. So spasms, so mechanical contractions, muscle contractions—today I should maybe call it cellular excitability, but we will see later what this is—is characterizing biological systems, particularly muscles and not only muscle tissue but also cardiac tissue, pancreatic, some pancreatic cells, nerve cells of course. They're all cells that would react if you would be given some electricity. And particularly the story was originally from different metals that were in touch with the... and so creating some sort of difference of electrostatic potential or electric field. I will review during next week's class some elementary concepts of electromagnetism such as electrostatic potentials, electric fields, Coulomb forces, so don't worry too much about that physics. And the interesting thing is that passing a current through the leg was creating a visible reaction, so much so that they would be measuring the speed of propagation. And as if you watch this video, this talk of mine, it basically... they invented neurophysiology. So it's not only them, it's people following, and they were in a... you know, historically, in a situation where people were still convinced that there was some sort of metaphysical principle in living organisms. And so the brain had this "animal electricity," "animal principle," "animal fluid" that was not knowable. So it could not be understood or measured, it was metaphysical, so it could not be measured. And people said, particularly people like Helmholtz or others, they were convinced that it was understandable by the laws of physics and chemistry, and they proved it. And they started a field that bioengineering is somehow building on today.

So I will stop and then we'll start later. So the question is that, I'll tell you what I will show you and then... so it will be... the question is that I will also have some electrical signals and it's just to entertain you and to make this four-hour class a little bit less heavy. And do you know Murphy's Law? So, of course, as I said, something that could go wrong, did go wrong. This is Murphy's Law. And apparently, I read yesterday that the guy was serious in the sense that he was basically, it was not only just a joke, he was actually saying, in engineering, it's guaranteed that things will fail. So, do organize so that things are not failing. In this particular case, it fails or it will fail, first of all, because I had a last-minute burnout. And secondly, in this environment, the noise is too large. I don't have a Faraday cage that would shield the noise, particularly this damn 50 Hertz noise, which is related to the power, to the alternating current that is in the power outlet. So also here. But even if I disconnect the laptop, it still will capture this very slow, oscillating electromagnetic interference, which is at 50 Hz. And we will see it immediately. And then there is also the ground loop that will prevent me from getting data. And I will use an electronic amplifier. I think that you are more than competent to understand that I need to amplify signals that are very, very tiny. I need to make them much stronger. It will not work if I plug my fingers in the input of this analog-to-digital converter. So the analog-to-digital converter, maybe you've heard, it will acquire analog signals. "Analog" because they are changing over time; they are signals that are changing in analogy to the physical quantities of the real world. And they will basically convert them to digital signals. Not only will they digitize them, but they will also sample them. I think that you might be all familiar with Nyquist. Do you know Nyquist? So anyway, he's one guy who made it very strict that in order to make signals usable on a computer, you cannot... with continuity, with temporal continuity... you need to observe it like with a stroboscopic flashing light at precise times, at precise moments in time. And the period is called the sampling period. And this guy here is sampling at... I will not tell you because it's one of the questions that I would like you to see... so a few hundred or a few thousand times per second. And I need an amplifier. But let me stop, otherwise I'll lose your attention. Let's break for 10 minutes and let's continue later. Thank you.

Yes? How are you? And this is for Teams but I think that you already have it or not? No, because in the university I have a lot of difficulty to start. Can't be yet, not yet, not yet, not yet. Okay. I thought I would ask if there was also a code. I said no, but it was just... Okay, thank you. Nothing. Correct, because we are going from here at 8:00. And in the middle of Mirandola? - But you have to write it if you can present it? - If you want to write it, then you can write it. - Yes, yes, absolutely. I don't know where it is, but it's in the center of the... and there should be a few halls. - No, with pleasure. If you are there, then it's... - If you have the fortune... - Okay. Maybe you can tell... Because in the center of the community there is not one bar, in a bar there is only a coffee machine and then... if you have a microphone it still works. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

#### **Section 4: Live EMG Demonstration**

So I'm a little bit disappointed because there is no noise. It's Murphy's Law in the opposite sense because it's working much better than at home. And there is no 50 Hertz noise. I wanted to show you this... no, well, it is noisy, but it's not the noise that I'm used to. So I will show you what... so I will tell you later the details of what I'm doing. And in the video recording, I'm using the webcam to show that I connected two electrodes to this part of my arm and the third electrode, which is the reference electrode—and I will tell you what this measurement is—I connected here below my... just a little bit below my left shoulder. And there is no noise. So I might attempt also the ECG, the electrocardiogram, also called EKG, but this one is called EMG. And so I am a frog in the sense that the electrodes are amplifying... I think the amplification is 100 times, and I'll tell you how in a moment. It is amplifying signals related to muscles. We know nothing about muscles, we will not study muscles per se, but you probably know that you don't have one big muscle, you have many fibers, and each fiber has its own electrical activity. So it's conceivable that if I do a voluntary contraction of the muscle... and by the way, I'm not able with this setup to look at nerve inputs. I could if I had a needle going in my skin. And in Zurich, when I told you that I attended a few courses during my PhD, there was one very charismatic professor that was putting a needle inside his own muscle, but I'm not that brave. And so what is now recording is something that is probably... I don't know what that pulse was. It could be an electrical artifact. I want to show you what happens if I simply try to contract my fist. And your criticism could be, "Wait, but if you move the electrodes, so if you apply movement, then you have artifacts." So you have to really... in order to convince you that what we are measuring is maybe related to the electrical activity of the living tissue, I have to try to see whether I can stay very still. And the difference will be striking. You will see when I contract, you will see that the variance will increase. It's the crucial moment, come on. Now take your time, I'm joking. But it is the crucial time. So all of these are artifacts probably because I'm moving and it's probably the wires, even the wires. But look what happens when I contract my fist. So I'm not moving, I'm just... those of you who are maybe more expert than I am would probably call this an isometric contraction, so I'm not moving any... correct me if I'm wrong, maybe it's not isometric. And as I keep it contracted, you actually see this increased variance and it seems that there are several oscillations. I just release and it goes away. I contract and I release. I contract and I release. I'm very proud that this works. I would say it took hours to do that. That's it. I wanted only to show that I can maybe zoom in, changing the scale, the vertical scale... that it's not going smaller than 20 millivolts per division, but what I can change is the time base, so how much time is per division by those squares. I can go much faster on a time base that is faster. And here you will actually see that the signal seems to have primitives that are not arbitrarily fast. It's not white noise, it's not arbitrarily going up and down. It seems to have some sort of dynamics of signals that are going up and down within a few tens of milliseconds. Each square is 50 milliseconds. Thank you.

### **Part 4: Future Directions: Computation and Bio-Hybrid Systems**

#### **Section 1: The Bionic Dream and Sensory Prosthetics**

...will be... you have to read the lips but okay, today is blah blah, you have seen it and I will try to find a way, presumably leaving the audio from the laptop and not having this one, so this is better and the audio will be a little bit lower quality but will not stop. I apologize, I charged it this morning but probably they cannot withstand three hours or four hours of class.

Okay, so... so even myself, I was particularly drawn to bioengineering or to the study of the brain for the same reason. In the 80s when I was a kid, there were ugly TV series like this one that was called *The Bionic Man*. It was an Air Force pilot that had a severe accident and because of the injuries, but he was so precious, the Secret Service said, "We can rebuild him." And they were actually replacing his visual cortex with an artificial eye, the arm that was amputated with a robotic arm that gave him super... like a fantastic force, the guy was... and particularly what was interesting is that they had an artificial eye connected to an artificial cortex. And okay, the legs, the limbs were trivial, okay, fine, you have robotic limbs, but it's okay. And then the guy was able to run at superhuman speeds. The funny thing is that they did the spin-off series, *The Bionic Woman*. Okay, this guy's title was *The Six Million Dollar Man*. It's ridiculous, particularly with today's exchange rate. The spin-off was *The Bionic Woman*, and they also had a mini-series on the bionic dog. It was fun.

So the story of being able to... we'll see later about motor prosthetics, but sensory prosthetics is another central point, and people over the past 50 years have made incredible progress. I don't remember, I think in November on Friday in Mirandola, we will host one guy working in Austria, in... I forgot the name of the city, it's not far from the border in Alto Adige. Okay, doesn't matter, and he works in a company that is doing cochlear prosthetics, cochlear implants, and making it possible for deaf patients to hear again. And here it seems to be a relatively easy problem because the cochlea is shaped like a *chiocciola*, from the animal, and it is related to the anatomy of one part of the auditory system, the periphery of the auditory system. And it is special because nature evolved it in a way that if you are able to unroll it—it's all wrapped on itself—but if you are able to make it a line, you have some sensory cells that have mechanical cilia, and these cilia are long or short depending on if you are in one spot of the cochlea or another. And you can probably guess that the longer or the shorter you are, you will change the resonance frequency if these things are sort of in touch with mechanical vibrations due to auditory sounds. So we have the tympanum and we have some liquid system and ultimately we have mechanical vibrations from the air related to these cilia. And depending on their length, they are able to perform as filters. They would not resonate... so the very short ones will not start to oscillate for my pitch of voice, but they would if, say, somebody would start speaking with a very high pitch, and they would because in that case, the frequency of the mechanical oscillation will be higher. You probably know that... okay, you don't anymore... you're not fond of house music, it's a different generation, so I don't know what you do when... when you don't go to the disco, but there it's very low frequencies, very low bass sounds, and in order to resonate, being an existing relationship between frequency and wavelength, you need long oscillating rods or cilia to detect and to oscillate, so to filter out this signal. So here you have what is called a tonotopic organization. So it's "topic" meaning there is some place, a placement that is mapping tones, which is very surprising. You have, say, violins here and the bass drums of house music or whatever you hear today at the other extreme. So it's conceivable that if you have not just one electrode like in DBS, deep brain stimulation, but if you have an array of electrodes in a way, because you may want to stimulate different spots, maybe you can process my voice, decompose it by Fourier transform into fundamental frequencies and stimulate different electrodes electrically depending on where they are. And of course, since the cochlea is not straight, you may design your electrode array in a way that is flexible and it's also kind of resembling the anatomical structure. So and it will be roughly being able to replace the nerve cells, the sensory neurons that are no longer working. So you don't have this... well, they might still be there, but they don't work anymore. And if you stimulate here, the underlying neuronal circuitry would still be expecting to get activated, because they would expect these guys physiologically to get activated when the frequencies are bass sounds, instead of the other ones from the other extreme, violins.

And the result is surprising, and there have been so many advances in signal processing to make it possible to learn or to adapt the way that sounds are processed in order to be converted into a frequency domain stimulation. And as you can imagine, now I'm making it as if we know how to electrically stimulate nerve cells. Maybe this is a sort of very tiny electroshock, like it is the electroshock here. I'm just exaggerating, it's not an electroshock, they're very, very tiny currents, but it is as if I'm blasting a very loud sound at you, expecting that you will answer a question. You are neurons, the question would be answered by emitting, say, some sort of encoded signal by having an action potential like this or like that, and I shout, and you probably are responding something, but first of all, I'm not able to speak to one cell at a time. I shout, all of you hear me, and maybe I traumatize you. You are shouting back, you are startled, and you are shouting back. So we are far from being able to talk to neurons. The story that I mentioned before, using light and optogenetics, is a more elegant thing, because not only can you shout, you can excite, but you can also silence, something that you cannot do with electrical stimulation.

The same concept has been explored for retinal prosthetics, where instead of having just a monodimensional array, you have a bidimensional array, like a fakir's bed. Have you ever seen an image of a fakir? *Un fachiro, un letto da fachiro*. In India, there were people, if you Google it, you will see people sitting on a bed of nails. So a bed, not with a mattress, but with a lot of individual nails. It's a comparison that I do very often. And it's sort of similar to what, in this case... this is not to be implanted in the eye of a patient, but in this case, it's an array... take a look and pass it around... it's a bidimensional array of microelectrodes. It's so tiny, made with CMOS technology, that you can't see it with the naked eye. And the green stuff that you see around is a printed circuit board, and it has a lot of contacts, and you can individually activate different electrodes in the retina. So here, a surgical operation is inserting this array of different electrodes on the floor of the retina. And if you have a camera mounted on glasses, you could maybe transfer by inductive coupling images processed on the camera to electrical pulses in the retina. And the guy is, of course, smiling because it was a promotional video from the company. But I think, if I'm not mistaken, this is the guy, or it's a different guy. This is the guy being able to see the moon again.

In the cochlea, I told you about tonotopy, so a tonotopic organization. In the retina, you have a retinotopic organization. So, points that are nearby in the world, just because of the optical properties of the lens, are projected... the light is projected to a nearby point in the plane of the retina. And so, if you stimulate nearby cells in the retina, technically they are called ganglion cells, then you are presumably eliciting some sensation, what are called phosphenes, of sensory stimulation. A blind person will actually see two small lights, two pixels, lighting up, and they will also be close by in the perception of the patient. So the concept is very simple and it's basically the same as a cochlear prosthetic device. Here, you stimulate depending on an image. Maybe the image was pixelated. And so if you stimulate different pixels, for instance, there is a light there that I see, and then there is darkness here, or vice versa. Here I see that it is bright, and here it is darker. I can stimulate a little bit stronger on the left, and then on the right, I stimulate less to give the same transition between bright and dark.

Something very interesting is that this company decided at some point, for reasons that are related to the market, which is another very interesting component that I hope can be discussed again on Friday, one of the Fridays of these colloquia in bioengineering at the end of December, middle of December. The last one will be one person that was responsible for these implants in Italy, and basically, they decided that it was not worth it. And to me, that is amazing. So, of course, I'm not motivated by and I'm not working in a professional, non-academic context, but to think that you, from one day to the next, you decide, "Look, the specific disease that these guys were suffering, Retinitis Pigmentosa, affects... it's a genetic disorder, it's a degenerative disorder related to a genetic condition, is only affecting a small number of people. So, there is no business." So, I don't know who was to make money. In reality, you could get... problems for making money. Because you would restore vision in blind people, which is amazing. I mean, isn't it the dream of everyone? Or you would be able to make a sort of artificial arm for an amputee patient. But then at least this was the situation about 10-15 years ago and Professor Silvestro Micera, I hope he will answer this question. We ran a project, a European project, and in this project, there was a big company called Otto Bock. It's a multinational but has its headquarters in Germany, and we were actually having them on board in this consortium of universities and partners. And they told me very clearly, "Fine, you can do whatever,"—at least 10 years ago, I don't know now if things are different—"you can do whatever robotic arm that you want, you can make a fantastic electrode-neuron or nerve cell or axon coupling as advanced as you want. I'm not going to sell it. I'm not going to sell it for you because health insurance in different countries will not pay for the robotic arms." The only thing that they would cover—again maybe this is different, it was like this 15 years ago—what they would cover is passive prosthetic things made of silicon that maybe have the possibility for a patient to, just with the other hand, contract it so that... so not something like in the *Star Wars* movie that would become independent, so you could control it by thought. And this was a very big surprise here. They decided that they didn't have a market, and this article says that the company withdrew, and there are still people with this device implanted. And it is like when a company, say, if Apple would go bankrupt, we would have computers and things for maybe a few more years, and then there would be no spare parts and no new computers. What they did, they did not go bankrupt; I think that they are focusing on a different approach that is more rewarding financially. That is, I'm not targeting only blind people because of that specific disorder of the retina, that can be Retinitis Pigmentosa, but also maculopathy, degenerative maculopathy. It's a very specific thing in the periphery, and maybe that's the reason why it worked nicely, because it's so simple. In the periphery, it works nicely. If you go higher in a hierarchy, it might be more complicated. I might be able, perhaps, to understand how to interface some sort of amplifier to the computer because I'm connecting via USB. It's a stupid comparison. I might have a hard time opening my computer and just operating on the motherboard. It would be a mess. It's so complicated. I don't have the schematics.

And here the idea is that they want to stimulate in the visual cortex. So even people that have, maybe they were born without eyes, they have a visual cortex. Okay, it will be more complicated, but they could receive this stimulator. So they would have glasses, and the glasses with the camera would transmit information directly to the visual cortex. How and where to stimulate in the cortex? Good luck. And particularly, so technology in terms of hardware, can be very advanced. Here you see another company... so this is, sorry, it's another company... it's a, if I remember correctly, it's an Illinois technology university. It's so small and this array of electrodes is even long, so they are not just like the one that you see, planar, that I'm circulating. These are able to go intracortically, they go inside the tissue, they don't stay in what is called subdural, so below the dura mater. That's a way to possibly stimulate different spots in the visual cortex electrically and obtain some sort of images, counting on the fact that you have retinotopy not only in the retina but you have it also in the visual cortex. The problem is that we don't know how to stimulate, what is the code. And another reason is that you may not want to electrically stimulate in a tissue that is excitable because if you stimulate a little bit too much, people could have a seizure, an epileptic seizure. And they, and patients had epileptic seizures during the clinical trial. Maybe it's easy because you basically stop stimulating, but the brain is a highly excitable tissue, so if you stimulate a little bit too much, then you have the entire cortex that goes nuts. So there are pros and cons.

Another thing that I invite you to think of is that if you have a camera in the frame of your glasses, and you're blind, okay, so you're blind, anything would work. You can no longer count on saccadic movement. Saccades are the rapid movements that we can do with our eyes, and you don't. Well, you could do that, but you don't have a functioning retina. So what you have to do is you have to move your head. And your brain is not used to moving the head while keeping the eyes straight. The eyes, particularly in a blind patient, would be constantly moving. And there are physiological mechanisms that are compensating for the fact that even if my eyes are moving, my perception is of a stable room. And even if I can move my head, there is a corollary compensation mechanism. Thank you. Thanks a lot. So this is also something that is worth devoting some thought to, because it's not trivial at all.

#### **Section 2: Motor Prosthetics and Brain-Computer Interfaces**

Let me move to motor prosthetics. Do you know this guy? Do you like him? I don't like him particularly, for many, many reasons. One thing is that he founded a company, Neuralink, and he started saying, this was several years ago, starting saying, "Neuroscience is over, we only need bioengineers." Okay, that would be good for you, but neuroscience is not solved. We don't know exactly how to make sense of electrophysiological signals. We know a little bit. And Neuralink made very big statements, promising, "We treat all diseases. Not only this, everybody will have, like in science fiction movies, *The Matrix* or *Johnny Mnemonic* and others, people will have a connect... well not necessarily a connector in the back of their head, but they will be able to interact with computers just with their brain, just by Bluetooth." And I don't know whether this is going to be the case, whether, yeah, you could maybe make sense of signals in my motor cortex if I'm a tetraplegic patient, and you can maybe decode if I had the arm, whether I would move it to the right or to the left. Maybe this you can decode, you can make sense of it, but forget about the complex multiple degrees of freedom. I don't remember how many degrees of freedom my hand has. It's probably about 20, 25, of that order of magnitude. And yeah, it's very complicated and we don't understand the motor system so well to say... "Of course, the guy is doing some... so I avoid that... so of course, this is encoding, we can decode his or her thoughts." Bold statement. And they also claimed that they were the first to have, last year, the first human implant. No, it's 20 years that people have done that in humans, even wirelessly. True, Musk, together with Apple, together with Samsung, they have access to amazing technology that would make it possible to do these things. This is just at the level of university consortia that don't have access to clean rooms where microchips are fabricated. And you know how small mobile phones have become. They have state-of-the-art hardware, but they don't yet have state-of-the-art neuroscience, because neuroscience is tough and it cannot necessarily be solved by injecting billions of euros or dollars.

So this is there, it was January last year. The problem is that by looking at specific parts of the brain in the motor cortex, a tetraplegic, paralyzed patient would have been able to use a cursor on a screen. By having electrodes connected to Bluetooth hardware, these are the electrodes that are implanted. So they are soft and they are not implanted by, like in some neurosurgical operations for deep brain stimulation, but they are implanted by a surgeon robot. I hope that it comes... It doesn't come. It's not this video. And of course, they call this telepathy, the first device. And I'm pissed off because this is clearly creating false illusions in patients. Sometimes, it doesn't happen so often, I have people writing via email saying, I've seen... so laypeople, so private citizens, writing to me and saying, "I've seen that you published this paper, could I bring you my mom that is suffering from Alzheimer's or from dementia?" No, I have no way to do it. Maybe what I do will make sense in 10, 20, 50 years. Instead, this guy is calling it telepathy, saying we cure all diseases.

So, I think it's this one. And in a moment, you will see that these electrodes are implanted. This is very cool, implanted by a robot surgeon that is able to avoid hitting the blood vessels and thereby avoiding causing a hemorrhage. This is very cool and it's done by infrared illumination. Blood will actually... fine, it's wireless so you actually don't see it in these animals, and you can record and stream via Bluetooth tens or hundreds of channels, and each dot is a nerve impulse detected in the sensory area of the animals. Here it's in the motor areas of the animal, and what you actually see... what you actually see... why? I need one of these. So what you actually see is there are markers. They could be stickers placed on a specific place of the limbs or by, say, image classification algorithms, if you want deep learning algorithms, but it doesn't matter, you can process a video, extracting at every single moment where the location of specific points is. And the algorithms are so smart that they could follow across frames in the video where my, say, my knee is in different frames. So if you do that you could plot the angle or the position as a function of time. And here the animal is not paralyzed; the animal is walking on this treadmill. And at the same time, you're recording in the motor cortex in the area that you know is responsible for controlling locomotion, and particularly the articulation of all those degrees of freedom. So you have the ground truth and you have the signal that you know contains that information. And so you build a neural classifier by learning, by training, and you compare it and you say, "Look how cool it is." It is cool that you can predict with high accuracy—so the continuous line is the actual position and the gray, the lighter line is the decoded signal from the brain. It is fantastic. But do this for a patient that is completely paralyzed. You cannot ask, "Okay, can you do a few hours of video walking because I need to... or moving your hand because I need to train my algorithm." And you know that machine learning is successful because it is now fed with huge, large datasets. If you have no dataset at all, it might be more complicated. Let me run it again.

So here you could decode a paralyzed patient. In this case, it's a motor action of the limbs of the animal. It's not particularly relevant or crucial, but it's a fantastic proof of concept. And in a moment you will probably see not only reading, but writing. When you see those bulbs, those cells, lighting up, it's because one particular electrode has been electrically activated. And one thing that you notice is that we are very far, even with Elon Musk, we are very far from the dream of playing the piano keyboard. Imagine that you hear, I don't know, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, and you say, "Okay, fine, now I would like to replicate it and I have a piano keyboard." Maybe you will never be able to replicate it exactly unless you are a very good musician, but at least you would like to press the piano buttons, the neurons, one at a time. You don't want to just go there with your elbow and press five or six keys of the piano keyboard. Here, you stimulate and you have a bunch of cells that are lighting up. It doesn't matter why they are bright. And this is, again, it's only a demonstration. So all these retinal prosthetics or cochlear prosthetics, sensory prosthetics, they are far from saying, "Oh, look, there is a small fly there and it's now changing direction, I know how..." We are very far even from the point of just the means of electrically eliciting a nerve impulse when we want. And this is the comparison with a keyboard, with a piano keyboard.

And at the same time, again repeating an experiment that was done 20 years earlier, here is the monkey. The motor cortex is again fed into an artificial... to a machine learning algorithm, and it's playing Pong. Pong from the 1970s, I remember it, it was the first video game. And the animal is not having a joystick; it's a small tube where it gets the reward. And so if you're a patient that is paralyzed... Wait a second, let me show you this. This was in 2012. If you're a tetraplegic patient and you're paralyzed, it might be worth experimenting on animals. And this lady is controlling this two or three degrees of freedom with a connector. So it was 2012, it was not Bluetooth, it was with a wire. I'm just showing you all this because maybe I perceive that some of you were correctly, understandably annoyed by the animal experiments, yet this is the goal, it's not the animal per se.

So, motor prosthetics is not only a cursor on the screen but also this robotic arm. This is massive, it's just because it's convenient to use something, this robotic arm that is already available, it's a commercial platform. And I think here, 2008, so many years ago, a different concept would make a patient, a tetraplegic patient... now this patient unfortunately died for other reasons, he didn't die because of this implant, he died because he did not survive heart complications, I think. And he was using computers almost 20 years ago by his thoughts. He was replying to emails, and here it's simply a different concept. You have an array of microelectrodes, this is like a bed of nails, each can be controlled individually and you're listening to the electrical pulses. It was a question but I think I answered it already. If you could read thoughts, what would you do? And I think in all your introductions, there was the idea of using it for therapeutic applications, and particularly in the case of tetraplegic patients, basically restoring some form of movement. Again, if you can read the thoughts but you have AI or you have some classification algorithm, you could maybe hope to gain insight even if you don't know the code. Maybe you could train with a patient saying over and over: "Please do whatever you want, but think of, if you had your arm, moving it, say, north or south." And at the same time, I record the electrical activity. There are huge problems. When do I start recording? When does it make sense? Maybe I can ask the patient, "When I play a sound, you start doing it." But one thing is to see the monkey there. The monkey was just getting the reward and he was no longer acting on a joystick that was used before for training. But for the tetraplegic patient that is not moving, it's a big deal to infer what the neural control is because we don't understand thoughts. We understand why just a tiny bit of an area of the motor cortex is getting activated a little bit, and we think that we are capturing the movement, move to the right or move to the left. In reality, probably the motor cortex is maybe even planning the trajectory. Motor actions are complex. It's not just "I move right or move left." I control all degrees of freedom to get my actuator in one point. Only to overwhelm you with a situation of complexity.

Swiss and Belgian chocolate in the supermarket, we have the code. We don't have the code for the spike train that was measured a few years ago in our lab. We don't know what it means. It's a rate code, does it matter? Is it the frequency of this nerve impulse that tells about the information? It's also this, but it's also the exact timing of the nerve impulse. And how? We don't know. It depends on where. In your spinal cord, you have neurons that if you have one kilogram, they will start firing at one frequency. And if I add another kilogram, two kilograms, the number of spikes per second—spikes, I call them spikes because they look like needles, action potentials, nerve impulses—the frequency would double. So it would correlate with the weight. But this is in the periphery. Very, very evolutionarily simple compared to motor planning in a primate. By the way, I'm standing as an inverted pendulum, I'm still gesturing and I'm not falling on the ground. It needs to be more complicated. So we don't have the Morse code, the Rosetta Stone, to make the comparison, what is what. This, we don't have. And yet, I think it's in this video here, I'll emphasize that the monkey... so this is from a pioneer from Duke University many years ago in 2008. I think it's a combination of these two videos. The guy is on YouTube and he has many, many talks and it was particularly impressive because he said, he described the surprise that the monkey at some point... here it's controlling the cursor on the screen with the joystick. At some point, the researchers basically swap and they say, "Okay, now we've trained the machine learning algorithm and basically we'll disconnect the joystick." And as the monkey continued to perform the task, what was interesting is that at some point—and the guy has a very strong Brazilian accent that I won't try to imitate—but he says, "We realized that we were making history because the monkey realized that he was no longer touching the joystick." And again, this is amazing. So the monkey learned to use a tool just by thought, realizing that it was no longer the hand, it was something else in the motor cortex that was controlling it. I show it to you because it's from more than 20 years ago and yeah, somehow we did learn a lot about this.

#### **Section 3: The Limits of Current Computing and Neuromorphic Engineering**

Before closing, maybe I will give you at the next week... we'll finish a little bit. There is another very crucial perspective that is not therapeutic, it is more related to a novel paradigm for computation. You probably learned that the so-called... what is the name... Moore's Law of doubling the number of transistors on a chip is predictable, so every year or every five years, I don't remember, there is progress in integration and therefore miniaturization and therefore power consumption. Now Moore's Law is no longer... it's starting to fail because transistors are getting so small that we are hitting quantum mechanical effects. They don't work anymore because they are maybe one or two atoms and they are no longer behaving like classic physics. So at some point, forget about having iPhone 19, iPhone 20, iPhone 21. At some point, it's not going to work. We have to end up with what we have. So computer scientists would immediately rise up, maybe some of you as computer scientists would tell me, and that's why now you have architectures with multiple cores, because we are anticipating this. Fine. Multiple cores implies that you need to become proficient in parallel programming. And again, good luck, because it's a very hard field to make, to transform any algorithm to make it parallel. There is still no recipe, and it may be that some things could be made parallel but other things may not.

But the real problem, and I'll show you this... this is from a movie a few years ago, I don't even remember what the movie was. They built robots that were sentient, that were intelligent, and the guy was learning and was scared. Interesting, it was in a nice context of a, say, degraded area of the city, and the guy started bonding with criminals. It's fun. He looked for imitation from cartoons of the 80s or started painting. Yeah, so it was fun. So this is still a dream of building artificial systems. The problem is that we don't yet have an artificial system with the same performance as the human brain. For some aspects, we are even beyond. For image recognition, we are definitely beyond human capabilities. The culprit, however, is the huge amount of power that you need to not only train but to run this device. I get by with three watt-hours from eating something, and you are probably starving now because four hours with me are heavy. For ChatGPT, you have on the order of two gigawatts per hour, and it's very intensive. There was a paper, an article in the news just reinforcing this story of unsustainable development. So the cloud, I'm sorry for the computer scientists in the room if they consider that to be... it cannot be the solution, it's not sustainable, even if you have nuclear plants that you are producing, because you need maybe 20 years to build one. And resources on the planet are starting now to already be less than what we need to operate our own civilization. So it's simply unsustainable.

There is another problem: the more you integrate electronics on a chip, the more heat dissipation is required. And in fact, you can only run a data center that is very large, maybe as large as this room, and to cool it down, maybe, you probably know Microsoft and many other providers are doing this, they are kept underwater, just in the water, for having a heat sink, just to dissipate heat in a better way. I don't... I can... my brain and your brains are happy, there are blood vessels that are definitely dissipating heat.

There is a sort of direction where bioengineering is going, which basically is skipping the application on humans, and it's basically taking the mimicry that has been very successful in nature. Planes, although they have not been directly inspired by birds, I'm pretty sure they were motivated because people wanted to fly. So here, it's a little bit more similar, so it's way more accurate. There is a field of engineering called neuromorphic, in which the same artificial electronic devices, or maybe even quantum devices, or even spintronic devices, are used or engineered with principles that are exactly the ones of how signals in the brain operate. So much so that they are able to mimic. In the early 2000s, there was one paper that appeared in *Science* entitled "A silicon neuron." It was one electronic circuit made of CMOS that was behaving sort of indistinguishably—although this is a very big statement—from a biological neuron. And if some of you are fond of playing with Legos, it's conceivable that if my brain is a collection of simple elements assembled in a complex way, maybe I can build in electronics neuromorphic circuits, which are a complicated assembly of elementary systems that are behaving and consuming very little power, like the brain. For those of you who are fond of or competent in or have reminiscences of electronics, digital electronics, ChatGPT, von Neumann architectures, use transistors as switches. Switches, and they switch between zero and one, and you probably know that there is a huge power load when you switch. Neuromorphic engineers use transistors as analog devices in a regime that is called weak inversion, and another way to call it, to identify how they operate, is called sub-threshold. So they use them as analog devices, for instance, to compute exponentials in hardware. You don't need to write a program; you have one transistor that is per se behaving as an exponential. Similarly, in a nerve cell, we will see it, one protein that is called an ion channel, it's a protein that is interleaved into the membrane of a cell, that one is a component, it's a protein, and it's performing as an exponential function. So this one-to-one mapping is inspiring a lot. And this is one paper that was published a few days ago, or maybe today or yesterday, where a neuromorphic system involving not a von Neumann architecture, not deep learning, not backpropagation, not large language models, attention, etc., but involving spikes, is able to perform similarly to the visual system. I'll omit what this predictive coding and what this is about.

#### **Section 4: The Biological Inspiration for Artificial Intelligence**

So, before closing in five minutes, I would like to emphasize two things you may not be aware of, but a large fraction of, at least at the beginning, how artificial neural networks started, and in general artificial intelligence, but more specifically machine learning, has been inspired by biology. The famous perceptron was invented by psychologists that were aware of how neurons were performing, that they were sort of all-or-none units and they were maybe emitting an action potential if their inputs were reaching some sort of threshold. Now from that point onwards, things diverged, because even the promise of building a circuit... this was John Hopfield many years ago, he got the Nobel Prize last year, probably you should know who he is. I mean, he's very important. He is the person in the 80s responsible for the end of the winter of AI. Marvin Minsky and others in the 60s killed AI, saying a perceptron cannot solve the XOR problem, so it's crap. Today we know that it's not entirely crap, but also because we have a lot of data and we have a lot of computational power. And Hopfield was, however, expecting or anticipating that we would have been building devices, physical devices, even materials that would perform like brain circuits. In reality, we end up having PyTorch, which is a very... it's a Python library and it's used, or yeah, I think it's the one of reference. So we end up having software, which again, it's not a very good idea because of power consumption. So the possibility of continuing to look at biology to extract principles is very, very timely and very relevant, because still, my brain is performing a variety of tasks and I don't need to see all of the internet in order to start speaking in a language. Admittedly, they are useful, but it's not... the holy grail is not going to be the current artificial neural networks.

I won't tell you about Neo, the character in *The Matrix* that is learning Kung Fu, because we are uploading knowledge. Maybe, that would be fantastic, but we are not yet there. The guy is able to have his cortex reprogrammed. We're not there. The guy knows Kung Fu. And unfortunately, we are not there. So, Elon Musk, sorry, but yeah, it's a very nice dream. Maybe what you did, that for sure, you advanced the hardware part, the technological part, in such a way that we can maybe now, if you are able also to release it to researchers, to experimental labs, maybe we can tweak it, maybe we can use it. Because so far, the best that you could do is moving a cursor like people have been doing for over 20 years.

#### **Section 5: The Frontier of Organoids and Biological Computing**

I think I'll stop here. I only wanted to mention this. Some of you mentioned the possibility of having stem cells or biotechnology, some of you. Something that we are also starting to do in the lab, and it was in the news yesterday or three days ago on the BBC... So, some of you will know that it's possible from skin cells, also from embryonic cells, to take cells and differentiate them into nerve cells, to build what are called induced pluripotent stem cells, and then differentiate them into whatever you want. And it's possible to do it and build mini-brains, although it's wrong, we should not call them mini-brains, although they do, they are called organoids. There is a company, if you go on this website, FinalSpark, they have an interesting business model. They claim, which is also my view and also the dream of some projects that we started in the lab, that in 50 years we will not only have to charge our phone, we will also have to give it a drop of sugar, because inherently there will be some biological component, a hybrid component that would absorb much, much less power and would have maybe some neurons, some biological neuronal network processing information and working at the same time. If you go here you will actually see live signals that are very similar to what we got in the lab.

Thank you for your attention, see you next week.


# Class 2 Transcript

### **Part 1: Course Preliminaries and Announcements**

#### **Introduction and Technical Difficulties**

Ok, I'm sorry that last week part of the lecture was not recorded. Those little microphones have a limited battery and they left me stranded. If you see it during the break with the microphone, please give me a signal because I will at least try to save [the recording]. I have a second ambient microphone, which is not great, but since it was not offered by the university, I have to buy it at my own expense. To be sure, there will be a bit of an echo, but you are here, so it shouldn't be a problem for you.

Okay, so today we continue and we finish this introductory content that I'm quite eager to present to you because in this way, concerning brain signals, you have at least an exposure to what kind of signals you can get.

#### **Attendance Tracking**

So that is the code for the tracking of your attendance. I emphasize it again: I don't really care. It's just for me for statistical purposes, to see or to disprove the hypothesis that for the first couple of classes you are brave and attending. As soon as I start writing some equations—maybe we start already today—you get scared and you don't show up to class. So please disprove me. It's not the QR code. The QR codes, I should remove them. The QR code is to download the app. It's the numeric code, alphabetical, **DC8R9**, that you have to add. So, if you have troubles during the break, I will put it on the slide again.

#### **Special Announcement: Guest Lecture**

An announcement. On Friday, we are very lucky, because we have quite a superstar coming to give a class for the entire morning. The program, as you know, is in Mirandola. This is part of the Colloquia in Bioengineering, which is actually a course that I give for the second-year students, or for your colleagues who started last year. And just because he's the one world expert—you can google him and you will see that he's very, very famous. He's a professor at EPFL, not only in Italy, at Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna. He's doing neuroprosthetics, particularly in amputees, restoring not only motor function but also sensation. He has a number of publications in very important journals: *Science*, *Nature*, and so on and so forth. The only catch is that it's in Mirandola. I don't know about the shuttle bus. Your colleagues from the second year told me that it was maybe for 25 seats. And they are less; there are probably 15 people, 16 people. They were fewer last Friday. So you could try to sneak in, and you could try to be on the bus and to try to go to Mirandola, or you try to travel to Mirandola on your own. Maybe you could ask the university to get refunded. There is the other logistic problem: the room that they showed me that will be next for next Friday has 25 seats. So if you all decide to come, we will not fit. Maybe we can have extra seats, but I would say I hope that I can invite him again next year, but you never know, particularly with very important people. They have a very busy schedule, so there is no guarantee. Yeah, please. No.

### **Part 2: The Scale of Neural Interfacing**

#### **Section 1: Neurons and Electrodes: A Matter of Scale**

There are still worse infrastructures. I have brought up the talk about the brain; you want to talk to neurons. And I ask myself, I ask for you, if you know how big is "big." So particularly, what is the rough size of a neuron, say the body, the cell body? Do you have any idea? How big is it? Nanometers? So, one nanometer... it's a little bit bigger. It's one order, three orders of magnitude larger. It's on the order of maybe 1 micrometer, 10 micrometers. The soma, the cell soma is around, I will show you in a moment, a micrograph is around 10 micrometers in diameter. And the very fine processes, the branches that branch out, the dendrites or the axons, they can be much, much tighter; they can be a fraction of a micrometer. But nanometer, no. But anyway, this brings up very interesting observations. Maybe you heard about the field of nanotechnologies and nanomaterials. It means that today we do have materials and possible devices that are smaller, a thousand times smaller than living cells. So in principle, you could think of answering the second question about "what about electrodes?" So in this case, I'm particularly referring to the deep brain stimulation electrodes, which are massive, as I tried to tell you. But I think in 10 years, electrodes, even those of Elon Musk's Neuralink, will become nanometer-sized. We can already build things that are nanometer-sized. One example, I don't know whether you've heard of it, is called carbon nanotubes, which are very tiny, and also silicon nanotubes and other materials, but carbon nanotubes are particularly interesting because I work with them, trying precisely to interface them with neurons. If you're smaller, like a Trojan horse, *Cavallo di Troia*, you could maybe think of putting something in the "stomach" of the neuron and maybe you're not injuring the neuron. And we will see why the injuring, the stabbing, this idea that I had that with an electrode you may puncture a neuron, will become maybe more delicate if you just have a very tiny needle that the neuron will not even know is there.

Now, any idea about these deep brain stimulation electrodes? Last week, I showed you the guy with Parkinson's that has an immense improvement in his motor symptoms. It's purely symptomatic, of course. And I told you that that technology is directly taken from heart pacemakers, with small modifications. So what do you think if these neurons are 10 micrometers in diameter? So, on the order of micrometers, what do you think these electrodes should be? Micrometers, but in reality, do you know how big they are? Just for you to think that people undergoing surgery, neurosurgery, to have these things inserted, they don't have a nanoscopic thing, but they have big stuff. Do you have any idea?

I'll show you, I think in the next slide. This is a sort of cartoonish reconstruction of a piece of cortex. It's only one type of cell that is depicted; it's the one that I like most. They are the pyramidal cells, and they are pyramid-shaped because their cell soma (somata, if it's plural) is shaped like a pyramid, and then you have this very long apical dendrite. It's called apical. From Greek, "apo" means "far." Right now we are going into the wintertime and the planet is getting closer to the sun, in the perihelion. But in summer we go to the aphelion. Anyway, so it's called "a privativa." And here you actually see the basal dendrites. And the axon here is not depicted, it's not reconstructed. This is a real example of a cell stained with a color technique, with a dye technique, invented by Camillo Golgi. And it's from the visual cortex of a cat. And here you see, purely by geometrical comparison, the very tip of a tungsten electrode. So if this thing is around maybe, again, tens of micrometers, then the tip here of this—this is an experimental tungsten electrode; it's a needle, it's an antenna—in research labs, it's probably maybe one micrometer or less. But see, in a moment, coming from there, you will see a huge deep brain stimulation electrode if it comes... come on... Yes. So it's immense. And imagine the big damage that it's causing. And the electrode is not like here, the very tip, that has not been insulated. There was here a USB-C cable that I wanted to play with. So you probably see that here it's all insulated with the exception of the tip. The tip, I'm just making it simple, the tip is metal. But here, so here I can get electrical signals; here no because there is insulation. So here is the same; here you don't, it's insulated by some plastic or Teflon. Here you have just this huge ring that is metal. It's typically platinum, and this is the insulation. There are maybe more than one active electrode. So you see, it's huge, and it is a massive damage to the structure of the brain where it is inserted.

#### **Section 2: Challenges in Neuroengineering**

So the challenges of the future, some of you will face, and they're still open in neuroengineering, are the fact that with these big electrodes, if you want to talk to the neurons, you're not selective. It would be like me shouting at you, instead of wanting to give a message only to one of your colleagues. Not because of privacy, but because I want him or her to receive and to listen to my voice, not the entire class. Otherwise, if I scream "fire, fire!" all of you will get panicked and will leave the room. Instead, I want only maybe one of you to leave the room, just making stupid examples. It's one of many stupid examples that I do, but it maybe gives you the analogy of why the stimulation is non-selective. And by the way, I cannot talk to a neuron on the basis of its genetic identity. If you are excitatory or inhibitory, it doesn't matter, provided that you are in the range of action of this extracellular voltage stimulation, or current stimulation, electrical current stimulation, you will be reached by the stimulus. Instead, I would love to talk only to those of you who are excitatory neurons. I can't today. Not with electrical stimulation. I can do it with optogenetics, but we will talk about that another time. With recording, if you want to listen, they are discontinuous and again non-selective. It would be as if during the break I start to listen to you, whether you are bored, whether you are hating my classes or not. I cannot, I can hardly distinguish your voices and I will hear a huge summation of all the voices. For diagnostics, for the EEG, electroencephalography, maybe I can live with that, but I'm more interested in understanding the information content of individual cells, and today I cannot do that.

And then there is an important thing, which is the fact that any tissue, any biological tissue, after you put in an implant, you might have a sort of inflammation and therefore tissue rejection of the foreign body. So the electrode starts to be immediately recognized as a foreigner and, as you know, particularly the brain has a very peculiar immune system as opposed to the rest of the body. The brain is encapsulated in the blood-brain barrier, which is easy to remember because it's BBB, blood-brain barrier, and it has its own immune system where you have cells that are called glial cells, *cellule della glia*. They immediately engulf whatever foreign object or bacteria or whatever, because it's so severe that if an infection occurs in the brain, you're not surviving. So evolution made it in a way that is so exquisitely reactive and so tight. So there is no rule. It's like in a cloud where you cannot enter, not even if you're invited. Well, maybe the blood-brain barrier can be fooled, but that's another story. Drugs, neuroactive compounds, are smaller than the pores of the blood-brain barrier, and they can enter.

And then there are issues with the information content. I have no code, I have no translation, no dictionary, so I don't know how to decode the signal. And something that is still not particularly developed, but it's a topic of bioengineering and neuroengineering in general, is the fact that you can also match experiments with mathematical model computer simulations. There is an entire course in the second optional course, only for those of you with a neuro-curriculum that I'm teaching. I started teaching it on Friday afternoon in the fantastic venue of Mirandola, just because your colleagues are already there.

### **Part 3: Modern Approaches and Modeling**

#### **Section 1: Advanced Electrode Technologies**

So the alternative, these are experimental directions that I would like to tell you about in one minute, just because I work on these solutions. Instead of having a massive electrode, maybe you could use an array of nanoscopic or, say, microscopic needles. So these are microwires, and these are even silicon nanowires that are even smaller. Here you see a comparison; this is an electron microscopy picture, scanning electron microscopy. You see that these things are so tiny, so the aspect ratio, which is the ratio between one size and the other of the geometry, is very high, meaning that they're very tall and very, very small, very tiny. They could actually penetrate maybe the membrane. So in this case, you don't see those that are vertical and they are where this neuron is sitting on. And in general, over the past maybe 10 years or so, some of these concepts have been used. So not only you have a piece of metal like this one and you keep it as an antenna, maybe you try to get closer to the speaker, you get closer to the neuron, but you want maybe to bring... this is inappropriate to say... So if the deity is not coming to the mountain, maybe the mountain comes to the deity. And so the idea is to have needles or protruding, three-dimensional electrodes, and you try to get closer to the neurons. There is one particular research that we play with in which, because neurons are so reactive, and so if you are not friendly with them, they will try to reject you. What we thought is that if we were to have some sort of structure that was decorated—so these are gold protruding three-dimensional microelectrodes that could be connected in the substrate—so if you decorate, if you attach to them, by some surface chemistry technique, some protein that makes the neuron think that that's food, it's not gold, it's not a metal electrode (in this case it's gold because chemistry is easier), maybe the neuron can be brought to embrace, to phagocytose. Technically it's called pinocytosis, but all cells are eating; it's called phagocytosis or endocytosis. But of course, if the neuron tries to engulf or embrace or phagocytose, the electrode will not be able to be broken by it. So it's not a particle or bacteria that the cell can, or food that the cell is trying to encapsulate, and then internally it cannot break it. But in this engulfment, the proximity between the electrode and the cell will be exquisite, will be very small, and if you pass a small current, you are guaranteed that you are talking only to one guy, because it's that one that is hugging you, not all of them. And it kind of works. So here you actually see, it's a work that was, it's a European project actually that I coordinated and it featured many collaborators from many countries. And I'll make a long story short. So here, indeed, at least in vitro, that means that we did not do it—well, we did not succeed at doing it in vivo in animals—cells, rat cortical neurons, seem to embrace these protruding things. This is the lateral section of one of these mushroom-like shape electrodes. And what you actually see here on the top of these electrodes, these are carbon nanocubes, for reasons that I'm not telling you.

#### **Section 2: Mathematical Modeling in Neuroscience**

So another thing that is very important is about the modeling part. So not only improving the technology, microfabrication, nanofabrication or nanotechnology, but also looking at mathematical descriptions. And we are going to use, to exploit, even in this course, mathematical descriptions to understand things. And maybe you are aware of this, maybe not. So this is just for purely historical reason. The equations that in 1952, two physiologists—so not engineers, not mathematicians, not physicists, two physiologists—wrote, it's a differential equation that describes, if you solve it, if you have a computer solving it, how the nerve impulse looks like as a function of time. So it goes up very rapidly, and then it goes down, and then it recovers, and then it goes to around minus 70 millivolts. And these two physiologists were so cool, they got a Nobel Prize in the 60s. They were so cool that they formulated an electrical equivalent circuit model. Of course, neurons are not circuits. They are not capacitors. They are not resistors. But you can have, by analogy, that the biophysics of cells is behaving with the same equations as the physics of electrical circuits. And this is very powerful, for instance, inspiring a field, neuromorphic engineering, where people are building electrical circuits that are mimicking neurons. Both are electrical devices, so why not have them in hardware?

This is one example of a big 10-year project that was concluded recently, a couple of years ago. It's called the Human Brain Project, in which individual models, mathematical models, with all this morphology, can be incorporated in a supercomputer, in a high-performance computing system, and all these differential equations associated to these hundreds of thousands of virtual neurons can be solved, and the communication between neurons can be studied. Here, it's a pretty movie where the color is encoding for the electrical potential. If it's red, it means that the membrane potential is positive, say plus 20 millivolts. If it's blue, it means that the membrane potential was minus 70 millivolts. Of course, people did more interesting things than this three-dimensional fly-through, which is purely aesthetic. To some extent, it's not particularly useful, because the only thing that you can see here is that maybe you get red, and then you get bluish, and then, okay, here it's too short to see. So maybe it's some sort of global... because the entire network was in a kind of synchronization, global oscillations, just to tell you that people are using that.

Out of curiosity, how many of you know what a supercomputer is? Any suggestion? Can you tell the others? Can you tell what particularly is fancy or not fancy about a supercomputer? "Ma perché hai un microprocessore bello carrozzato?" (But why do you have a nicely beefed-up microprocessor?) Things faster. So the only way, and I told you maybe last week that we are already doing it on, even on mobile phones, we are doing a sort of parallel computing with multiple cores, and a supercomputer is a collection of nodes, literally computers attached with Ethernet cables in a network. And so if you run a simulation, that's your responsibility, you can distribute the job. So you can distribute the program across many computers. So, and how would you run a simulation of a piece of brain on a supercomputer, having said that it's a collection of hundreds of thousands of computers, of cores or processors? Any idea, what would you exploit in this parallelism of the electronic hardware? How could you make it work? In principle what people have been doing is having one neuron per processor. To mention how difficult or how computationally intensive it is to simulate only one neuron. So if the brain is a collection of things and they are communicating, maybe you could do the same if you have a collection of processors and the processors are communicating with an internet local area network cable. Just for you to be curious.

### **Part 4: Electrophysiological Signals: From Single Neurons to Networks**

#### **Section 1: The Visual System: Hubel and Wiesel's Discoveries**

Now, I would like to give you some examples of brain signals that have this electrophysiological component. And I'll mention, I will start with the work in the 60s of two researchers. They were both, I think, medical doctors. And the guy here is the author of the book that I suggested to you, that is in the readings, in the GitHub repository. I strongly recommend you to read it. It's very light. Probably it will take a couple of weeks if you read a little bit of it. But it's a tiny book. Of course, as a PDF, you don't have any indication of how big it is. So David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel—this guy is today 102 years old, 101 years old, I was surprised. I am happy. They both got the Nobel Prize in 1981 for their discovery on the visual system. And they made experiments looking at the electrical activity, at electrophysiological signals of neurons in a cat, anesthetized, and they were recording from the occipital part of the cat's cortex. It would be as if, but I'm not suggesting it, someone would stick an electrode into your brain, into your occipital cortex, while you're staring at this screen. They didn't have a video projector, but they had a system where they could, you'll see in a moment, project stimuli, light stimuli, say for instance a small white dot, and they could change the position of the dot, they could change the diameter of the dot, etc. Maybe they could show a bar, we will see, while the animal, anesthetized with its eyes open, was staring at them. And of course, one objection is clearly the animal is anesthetized, so you're not guaranteed that the brain is actually processing information in the same way, and this is a well-taken objection. On the other hand, sensory systems are normally not necessarily affected by anesthesia. What matters with anesthesia is that your cortex usually is like when you dream, particularly during slow-wave sleep, when you are in the second phase of sleep; you are basically disconnected from the sensory system. There is a station in between that is called the thalamus, and the thalamus is like a gate, and the gate is closed while you sleep. Possibly because if the phone rings, you are not necessarily reacting. The cortex is not... maybe the cortex can still dream, but it's disconnected from sensory systems, with the exception of one sensory system that is very ancient, which is olfaction. The olfactory bulb bypasses the thalamus. It's going directly into the cortex.

So I will show you some recording. Why the animals... and what they did, they had an amplifier, and they connected the amplifier to a loudspeaker. So if you have a very fast transient, you probably know that if sounds are made of frequencies, and Fourier proved this, and if the changes over time are very abrupt, it means that in the frequency domain you have a very broad distribution of energy. If it's broad, it means that it's also broad for high frequency, in the frequency domain for high frequencies, that means you will hear it. And you hear it as a sort of "tak-tak-tak-tak-tak." During the weekend I was playing radio and I was trying to make contact with Morse code. My radio has a decoder. Just to give you an example in which in this case you have small sounds that are short, "dit," and longer sounds that are longer and they are "dah," and you will hear it. And the guy in a moment is giving some numbers and gives his name. He says "operator is..." So here is different, because we don't know the codes that neurons are using. And we don't have two symbols. For Morse code you have brief and long, it's digital. You also have the pause, but that's another story. For a neuron, you only have when the neuron is firing. And the interesting thing is, okay, when does it fire? It could be that it fires not once, it fires a given number of times, and so maybe the frequency of firing is making sense.

Now you will hear about one neuron that is very close to the tungsten electrode, so we only hear its voice. We are sort of confident that we only hear from one neuron. And the animal is staring at the screen. So you will be staring at the same screen. And in this case the recording has been done in the retina, in the outer layer of the retina, which is called the ganglion cell layer. I'm here and I'll ask you to pay attention, to try to do, although you can't because you don't have the Rosetta Stone, the dictionary, like I tried to do during the weekend, tried by ear to decode the message. So here the question for you is just be aware, be concentrated, just to try to understand when this neuron is responding. And the neuron is responding with a sound. You will hear—it's why they call it neuronal firing, *sparo*—you will hear it in a moment. Second is, not only when or what is the neuron responding to—maybe it responds when it's dark, maybe it responds when it's light, maybe it responds with a particular shape. Maybe some of you heard about the story of the "Jennifer Aniston cell." A few years ago, there was a paper showing that a patient, a human patient, awake, with an electrode, had one cell that was only showing, only firing, only responding, when the patient was shown pictures of Jennifer Aniston. It was not always the same picture. It could be Jennifer Aniston at the beach, Jennifer Aniston drinking coffee, Jennifer Aniston in the early morning. So it was not the same picture. And that cell was not in the visual cortex; it was more in the associative areas, say, in the frontal areas. Listen. Here is different. But the question would remain: Jennifer Aniston would not be shown, but what features of the stimulus are exciting the neuron? And so, if you are very advanced, you could start thinking, assuming, and I tell you that these neurons are performing some sort of information processing, some computation, what kind of computation is it? So here it is. No. I want to use that loudspeaker. This is me, and it's not a mirror. *coughing* I'm going to go.

Do you want to see it again? Or do you have some ideas? Go ahead. "Naturalmente." (Naturally.) In fact, that's why they were trying maybe to have an elongated stimulus instead of a focused stimulus. Maybe they tried to change the size of the stimulus. They tried to make it dark in the center and light around. And if you were careful, you could hear that the neuron was firing sometimes differently, sometimes not differently. Go ahead. No, the retina, ganglion cells. And in a way, being in the retina means that it's already a major complexity in terms of information processing. It's not like a webcam. It's not a pixel of the webcam, for sure, because you could see that it was doing something strange. It was not responding to... So apparently there was one area that was indicated by, so it was written, highlighted on the paper, on the paper screen. I cannot write on this screen, otherwise they will kill me. So that one is called the receptive field. And people, so they actually tried to search for it, tried to see what is the area of the world, in the sensory part of the world, where if you have a stimulus there, the cell is responding. Because if the cell is around here or here, it's not responding selectively to that stimulus.

Let me show you it again with some commentary. It seems that it needs to be there, in the circle. But it seems that it's also responding when the light is much larger than the small circle. At least now, with this, it seems to be the case. I'll throw some random ideas because it's very, very interesting. And they could do, of course they did some quantitative analysis, but it was just because they could hear and they could see these correlations that they understood what these neurons were doing. And then of course it's about almost 70 years of research trying to understand how this is done.

One thing that you notice is that the neurons are also responding spontaneously when there is no light. They are not completely silent. Normally, so they have a spontaneous activity. Let me very briefly... Sorry... Ah... Spoiler... So even when the stimulus is not around, the cell is still having some spontaneous activity. Maybe it could surprise you, maybe not. After all, we are 37 degrees Celsius temperature animals. So there is some noise, and even the systems that we are building in electronics, they are noisy. So it's not a surprise that if you don't do anything, still the system is responding. But it's not responding strongly. Something that maybe those of you who are maybe musicians will hear is that when the light is on, you may hear some sort of "zzzzz" and then the sound frequency is decreasing. It's as if you hear this. So there is some sort of what is called adaptation, some sort of slowing down. And this is interesting because it's in all evolutionary sensory systems. You also have it in your skin. You have sensory receptors in your skin. And if somebody would grab you from the back right now, you would startle. You would be scared. You would have a reaction. There would be a reflex arc, *un arco riflesso*. It would be perfectly normal. But of course, now you are probably wearing your shirt or whatever, t-shirt or whatever, on your shoulders for many hours. And you're not completely aware of it, but you still have it on your skin. It's because your sensory cells, in that case they are mechanoreceptors, here they are not light receptors because these guys are not really, they're not light-sensitive per se. It's the last layer of a chain of processing, but these guys are also losing interest. If the light is there for too long, at the beginning they respond, but then it relaxes. Because maybe evolutionary what matters is if a tiger enters the room. So it's the change. When the world changes, then I have to take notice. If the world is stationary, it's boring. But that's another story. And there are things that you might hear. So when the light is off, still you hear spontaneous activity. But look what happens now. So it seems that if you have light all around, but in the middle, in the same receptive field, you have darkness, then things are a little bit different. Could you understand? Could you not? Could you hear it? What was the difference? No, the retard that you feel is because when they are on the stimulus there is a rebound and the cell starts to fire. I will show you why it is crucial. You have to feel what you do immediately before the stimulus is given. No way. Could you hear it? It might have shut off. So if you have dark in the center and light around, it stops. And if you have one particular orientation or another one, it's the same. So any more ideas? Any other things that you noticed? You heard it on this slide, you have all the comments that we could make.

So, one is that there exists a space in the sensory world, in the world, that is called a receptive field. It's a field that, if the stimulus is there, the cell is responding to. So, you could probably imagine that other cells, so other neurons sitting nearby, would respond to a different receptive field. There is no orientation selectivity, suggesting that there might be other cells, maybe not in the retina, maybe there are other cells that would have some preference, some preference for a particular orientation. Here it's bright and here it's dark. So maybe it matters if you have these contrast differences. And the cell is firing nerve impulses, even spontaneously, but at a low rate. And another thing that was interesting is it's not doing it as a pacemaker, but it's doing it like a sort of Geiger counter, like in radioactive Geiger counters. It seems to be random. It's a random process. And just opening and closing a parenthesis about this randomness: Even Mandelbrot, the mathematician who studied these Mandelbrot sets, these beautiful things, fractals that you might have heard of, he was also studying neurons because of their stochastic properties, the fact that they are irregular and they are kind of unpredictable. And technically, the best model is a Poisson point process, for those of you who have vague reminiscences of stochastic processes in probability theory.

When the light is in the center, it fires, but when the light is around and in the center at the same time, there is a little bit of suppression. Sorry, no, no, sorry, sorry. This means that if you have the black spot in the center, so if the light is in the surround... So, we have a distinction between surround and center. It's a sort of ring, and then the center can be... so there can be light in the surround and darkness in the center, or vice versa. And if it's vice versa, it responds. If it's instead darkness in the center and light around, then you have suppression. So, yeah, the cell is firing normally spontaneously, but when darkness is in the center, it actually is also even suppressed, even below the spontaneous rate. And the cell fires if the light is everywhere. And something that I told you, it's not... if I should depict it graphically, you will see that there is some sort of fatigue. So the rate, number of pulses per second, number of sounds per second, is decreasing in time. Please. Of course, of course, absolutely. The image that you see of me and of your colleagues is the result of a population code. Each cell is like this. It seems that cells are highly specialized, but cells are connected in a network. And the connectivity gives rise to these emerging properties. This one, it's only isolated, and we could understand that this one was specifically caring about that receptive field, and it was what is called a center-surround cell. And in this particular case, this one is center-on, surround-off. There are other cells in the retina, and the ganglion cells that are the opposite. They will be center-off, surround-on. So they would fire with a different logic.

And in the story of on and off or this center-surround, the fact that you have contrast, darkness around, darkness in the center, or if you have darkness in the center this one was suppressing, instead the other type with darkness in the center would be instead more excited, is the basis of one typical operation of image processing that maybe none of you today with this generative AI models, with Sora, with Gemini, whatever model for generating images, you probably never played with Paint software or Photoshop. But maybe you did, I don't know. Okay, something that is also important is that switching off the light causes a rebound. So when the darkness was in the center, the cell was silent, all was silent. But then when the light was removed, when everything was removed, there was some sort of rebound. So before there was some spontaneous activity, and also later there was spontaneous activity, but during the presentation of the darkness, there was silence. And then here there was a little bit more, like a rebound, like when a drug addict is not consuming his or her drug, then, when you remove this inhibition, when you disinhibit, it has a rebound. It has some sort of abstinence crisis. Here, in engineering terms, you can see that this is a sort of high-pass frequency filter. So, it actually doesn't want to respond to some steady input. It wants to take the derivative, and you probably know that the derivative of a step... Maybe you don't like the step. Assume that the light is switched on with some ramp. You know that the derivative here is zero because here it's constant in time. Here it's also zero because it's constant in time. The only time when the derivative is non-zero is here, when there is a peak. So these cells are doing derivatives. And of course, when you are switching off, so here you also have some sort of derivative. So these cells are still a high-pass filter and they respond to the change, to the transitions. And other cells are showing the opposite.

About computation, did anybody play with Photoshop? Or with any image processing things? Did you ever apply filters? There are filters to extract things. So there is one thing, if you can, if you have any software that could do some elementary image processing, try to play with it. If you apply a spatial derivative filter, which is enhancing whenever there is a contrast difference, whenever there is a light and dark, you extract the edges. So if you have a picture of my face, you will actually process it with this. Maybe I can try to do it, but I don't have Photoshop on my computer, but I will try. You end up with a picture, with a new picture, in which whenever there are areas that are not having contrast changes, they are dark, because in space the derivative is a derivative of something that is uniform, like here the derivative of a constant in time is zero. The derivative of an area that is roughly uniform is zero. But what matters are the edges. And indeed, you would extract the edges. So the retina, it's an oversimplification, is an edge detector. Here you don't actually see it because with the edges, you would actually say, "No, look, I would like to have an understanding if the edges are vertical, are horizontal," because if they are vertical, I could probably say, "Oh, this guy has a big nose and it's vertical. It's in the middle of the face, so that must be a face." And by the way, this seems to be the way we recognize faces, but not in the retina. So for me to enter the room, for me it's very important to see vertical transitions, bright and dark. And something that is interesting is that retinal prosthetics, this artificial device that was implanted in the eye, since it was stimulating ganglion cells electrically, probably was getting for free some spatial processing, so these edge detectors. And so it's a contrast detector. It detects edges. Because in the end, you could probably... it's boring to see, with the exception of when I write, it's boring to see or to devote energy or information, even metabolic energy, to the world, to represent the world in your brain when everything is uniform, when it's not interesting. You have the impression that the brain is filling in, so you actually see that there is a wall that is white, but no cell is responding to the white. The cells, you have cells that are responding to the transitions, which makes sense because you have very limited resources. If you have to build a system with a few hundreds of thousands of detectors, maybe you want to optimize and not have something that is pixel-by-pixel related to the intensity; you want a way to extract some information that is relevant for behavior. I'll stop here by asking, and we'll start later, how if you could, even if you know nothing about how the retina is wired, but imagine that you have at least one layer that is photoreceptors, like a camera, like a CCD camera, pixel and pixel and pixel, how would you build the circuit for a ganglion cell to receive this information and to relay it downstream, to extract edges? How would you do that? Knowing that in the center there is a positive response, it's a sort of excitatory response, and in the surround you have some other field, and if you have light in the surround but not in the center, you are inhibiting the cell. We'll stop here for 10 minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

#### **Section 2: The Neural Circuitry of Center-Surround Fields**

Okay, let me restart. Let me again ask you the same question about how we build it. How we build a system that is center-on, surround-off or vice versa. So, let me say that I have this... This would be the photoreceptors. Receptors of the retina. So here, maybe you can imagine that there are pixels. And here you have this neuron that is the one that you were recording its electrical activity from. And there is an area of the world on the screen that was projected through the lens inside the retina. So you could say the receptive field on the screen was actually mapped onto an area that was probably circular, because the lens is a linear system, and so unless there is aberration... Okay, it's not an ideal lens, so there will be some non-ideality, but on a first approximation, a circle in the world would be a circle projected in my retina. So you will have different pixels, different sensory photoreceptors. By the way, they are called cones and rods. *Coni e bastoncelli*. I believe that in elementary school, in primary school, you heard abundantly about that. I don't care about the... of the eye. I don't care. What is cool is that the cones, if I remember correctly, those are for the colors, are specialized in red, green, and blue, which is the typical... from the medical bonus that you regulate. Again, if you're playing with Photoshop, this is what you play with. But that's another story.

So how would you make it in a way that... so this would be the surround, and again here you have a lot of other cells, and these cells are, they have axons, they have output wires, okay, and they are like all the neurons, they are very eager to connect, because being in isolation is a crack for people, cells, societies, countries, etc. And so, how would you wire, what would be the wiring diagram of this system, which I anticipate is not correct, but it doesn't matter. Just for you to do the exercise. So what you have is the possibility to distinguish between synapses that are excitatory and synapses that are inhibitory. An excitatory synapse would be a synapse that, if it's activated, will excite the target. For the moment, I will not tell you about... Maybe Zoli might have started telling you about biochemical signals and might have already told you about neurotransmitters, excitatory and inhibitory. Did he do so? Yes. So you know already about the story. So why? No. So glutamate and GABA, gamma-aminobutyric acid, are two of the main central nervous system neurotransmitters. One is excitatory and one is inhibitory. So you have that some synapse could, you could choose it. So you could have excitatory or inhibitory at your will. This may not be entirely correct, but that's what we'll talk about later. And this is your target. So this is your post-synaptic cell, post-synaptic neuron. And this is the ganglion cell that we recorded from. Hubel and Wiesel recorded from it. So this is... It's in the ganglion layer. It's a ganglion cell. And this is, for instance, surround-on, center-off. No. Surround-on, surround-off, center-on. That doesn't matter. So just if you tell me that here you want to have light, when you have light here, and these guys are activated, I want this guy to be excited. How do I do it? How do I connect? Can maybe some of you come to do that or you tell me how should I wire? So here I have axons. Give me some ideas. What's the difference? What's the difference in terms of cables at this level of understanding that I'm trying to pass to you? You have processors and you have connections. Connections are, I'm inclined to think they are feed-forward, so they are not recurrent. You don't have bidirectional connectivity, and they are feed-forward. So it's like the perceptron, although maybe you know or you don't what the perceptron is. You have some sort of algebra, that you have excitatory, which is making the post-synaptic cell go up, and inhibitory to go down. Down in a supposedly excitatory, excitation state. You want to favor or you want to depress. If I have an inhibitory synapse and I'm projecting to one of you, if I'm excited because you shine light on me, but the synapse is inhibitory, when I'm excited, I will secrete GABA and my post-synaptic target will be depressed, will be silent.

So what I'm trying maybe to inspire you to do is to see whether maybe you would connect the center with excitatory synapses. And the surround, if the surround is off, I made a mess here, okay, where the surround is off, so if I have light only in the surround, like the one that we have seen, if the light is here, these cells of the retina are excited, but this guy is silent. So I was hoping that maybe you could have said, "Okay, so this cell is going to be excited." It's a photoreceptor when light is invading it, but the axon is projecting with an inhibitory synapse. So all here are inhibitory synapses from the surrounding, and from the center you have the plus. You can try to think of this conceptual model, and it works. At least it works explaining some of the observations, not all. And in fact, we know now that this is not how things work in the retina. But it's interesting because just by a simple algebra, you could have that some projections are like on a car, are accelerating, others are like brakes, and they are stopping the same neuron. The post-synaptic neuron, you can think of something that is making the summation. You could think of a capacitor, and it would not be a wrong assumption, that is summating inputs. The capacitor, as you know, it's an integrator in time, it's integrating the signals, and it's keeping memory, right? In the charge, in the plates.

And so, in order to get this, this is the same thing, but not with sound, but with traces. If the light is in the center, you see, before there was spontaneous activity, then here, this is when the light was switched on, the frequency increases, and here, if you squint your eyes a little bit, you see that here, the number of small pulses is with higher density. So there, I don't bump on the table, but I bump here. So it's... So here it's higher spikes or pulses per second, and then it's relaxing. Here it's... okay, here when you switch off, it goes back to spontaneous activity, which has even lower activity. Here, when the activity, when the light is in the surround, you see here it's truly silent. Well, not entirely, there was one random pulse emitted, but it's really suppressed. So it means that when the light is in the surrounding, you probably have to invoke some inhibition, some inhibitory mechanism to brake the same post-synaptic cell. So the connections, the wiring, might determine the function. And here is if you have light on the entire thing, what happens is that you have both at the same time, you have activation of both the excitatory and the inhibitory synapses. And the fact that here you have more spikes means that, okay, these synapses from the center are either more numerous or they are more effective, they are with a stronger coefficient. So yes, true, you are doing simultaneously the averaging, the arithmetic combination of both the excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Excitatory, I imagine, like positive numbers. Inhibitory, there will be negative numbers. Okay, here, the excitatory numbers are winning. Fine. Not particularly shocking. What was important for me is to push you at least once to try to think about these circuits.

#### **Section 3: Higher-Order Processing in the Visual Cortex**

Now, I'll show you what happens if you record in the visual cortex. So, a couple of stations, of relay stations... I'm skipping the thalamus. In the thalamus there is a region that is called the LGN, doesn't matter if you know it or not. In the Hubel book, *Eye, Brain, and Vision*, *Occhio, Cervello, Visione*, it's indicated. So you have all these things explained in a very nice way. Here we are skipping the thalamus. We are directly recording in the primary visual cortex. Because as you can imagine, there is a hierarchy of areas in the cortex for vision. Like in deep networks. By the way, they were directly inspired by the visual system. So here is a cortical cell. And again, the question is the same. What is the feature the neuron is responding to? Where and what is it? And again, what are the specific features that are making the neuron fire or maybe be inhibited? And what computation? Is it the same computation? No? No? No. No. Okay. It will get a little bit better in a moment in the video. It's from the 80s or earlier. So it's actually putting some plus or some... So even here, you have a receptive field, but it's not circular. You have the same thing that when the light is on, you have a lot of spikes and then there is adaptation. And it seems that if you excite a sound in the periphery, it's sort of silenced. Okay, it's not writing minus, but this is like the surround-off of a moment ago. There it was a ring, here there is a direction preference, also for the off-response. It's a little bit more difficult to hear because you have less spontaneous activity here. It doesn't work. You need to have the exact orientation, otherwise you excite both, you illuminate both the on and off centers. So it needs to be 45 degrees. If it's like this, the response is much less. So there is a tuning preference. The quality of the stimulus has to be tuned to the correct angle. If it's everywhere, it means the "off" part. And the fact that here you hear the rebound is because you are in the off part. Now you are both in the on and off part. So the on wins.

So this is called simple cells. There is one orientation. This cell was specifically responding to that, and this is another sort of silly cartoon for a wiring diagram having different ganglion cells, so these are different ganglion cells, each with its own receptive fields, they are particularly aligned on the same line. So, because these four cells have receptive fields that are aligned, if they all project with an excitatory or inhibitory synaptic connection to this cortical cell, then you will get this preferential direction-selective cell.

This is another example, which is more interesting. It's still in the visual cortex. Let me know if you understand what this is doing. What is this doing before the guy writes something that will spoil it? Could you see it? Only seems to be direction-selective... Ok, I spoiled it. Not only is it orientation-selective, but it's also direction-selective. It's only when the stimulus goes from right to left that you have the response. In the other direction, it doesn't work. It only works if you have something moving in one direction. You can try to think whether you can do a sort of circuit, a functional circuit like this. You will see that it's not trivial because what is happening here is that you have time. You have movement. So it's not that straightforward. You could try. It could be an interesting mental experiment. So in this case it's both orientation and direction-selective. Which is very cool.

Something that I mentioned last time, I wanted to clarify, I don't know whether... So I mentioned retinotopy as well as tonotopy. Tonotopy was in the auditory processing areas of the brain as well as in the cochlea. That's why cochlear implants are doable, are not easy, but they are doable. Retinotopy is the fact that points nearby in the world are projecting to points nearby in the retina, and they are, I tell you now, projecting to points nearby in the visual cortex. So in principle, if you want to restore vision in a blind patient, you could think of having a camera, and if there are two pixels of the world nearby, you could stimulate two points in the cortex that are nearby in the cortex. There is a small caveat which is interesting enough. We are over-representing what is in the exact center. If you keep your eyes straight, it's called the fovea. So it's not like a CCD camera. This one is 4K. It means that it has 4K, 4000 pixels, or 4 million pixels, it should be 4 million pixels, and they are uniformly distributed in the plane of the sensor. There is no area in which there are more. If you had it, you would have a hard time displaying the images because you don't have more pixels and your screen would need to accordingly have more pixels in the central part. We do that because when we read or when we have to do something very carefully, we need maximal spatial resolution. And so the only way is to have the largest number of photoreceptors. But in the periphery, you can try, I cannot read. I cannot read these letters if it's, not only because I wear glasses, but I don't. I see that there is a bottle, and that's maybe okay for if a tiger enters the room while I'm looking at you. But if I want to read, I have to bring it into the fovea where I have the maximum resolution. In the cortex you have this sort of deformation which I'm not telling you about here. Many, many years ago they did an experiment with a macaque monkey staring at a screen while being anesthetized. So the gaze was fixed, there were no saccades, there were no movements, it was fixed. And immediately after they could process the cortex, they sacrificed the animal, and immediately after they processed the tissue and they could see where the areas of the visual cortex were most metabolically active. So they could basically have some sort of imprinting of the image, at least radioactively, to tell what's in the cortex, where the neurons were that were most active. And this, I admit that it's not a technique, or it would deserve more explanation, but it's not worth it, it's not crucial. There is some sort of deformation.

#### **Section 4: The Brain's GPS: Place Cells and Grid Cells**

I'll show you another example of electrophysiological signals. These are more higher-order, they are not related to sensory systems, and they resulted also in a Nobel Prize a few years ago, it's about 10 years ago. John O'Keefe is a UK researcher who first studied the hippocampus and found something very cool that I'll show you in a moment. And then two Norwegian researchers that were, before they were a couple, Moser and Moser, who studied similar experiments in the entorhinal cortex. And they were, as you can see, this is not about vision, it's about behavior and cognition and navigation. And it was worth a Nobel Prize. But again, I ask you to pay attention. What you will see is not an animal. We will not be recording with electrodes attached to a loudspeaker. You will actually see the top view of a small arena in which a rat is moving. And the animal has one electrode implanted in the hippocampus. So the animal is not anesthetized. He is awake and behaving. And whenever there is, in this recording, a nerve impulse, just because I'm recording the video, I actually put where the head of the animal is in that moment, I put a small red dot. So if the cell, if I'm here and the cell is firing, then I put a red dot so that it will stay in the plane of the image, it will stay that when the animal was here, the cell was active. It will make sense in a moment. So pay attention. I'm asking you whether you can understand when or what this neuron is paying attention to, and what computation it might be useful for. Computation meaning maybe what kind of behavior, what kind of something that maybe you do, maybe not every time, every day, that you probably are doing.

So this is the top view. This is a big rat. And you see that the red dots are at that moment in time when there was a pulse recorded by the electrodes implanted in the hippocampus. And the experimenter is giving some treats, some food, so that the animal is exploring an otherwise boring arena. Typically after a while, animals are not exploring; they are getting bored. And there is one specific receptive field, if you want, that this hippocampal neuron is responding to. What is it? It's relatively easy. Any idea? No. I'd say I have no time, maybe I can replay the video, but it's not so complicated. Say now even when the hand is not there, ok, it's difficult because it's accelerated, but even if there is no one in the room the cell would perform the same way. It's only that the rat may not be willing to move around. So it's only when the animal moves and explores the arena that something in the hippocampus happens. You know that you can even answer, even propose, I don't care, even if it's a crazy idea, I'm not saying, I'm not judging and remembering, "Ah, this guy was at the exam..." I don't care. I would love to invite you to think, to be critical, to formulate hypotheses, to try to be curious, to feed your curiosity. "Potrebbe avere ragione, ma non è." (You could be right, but you're not.) "E qui, purtroppo, la mano è disgraziata perché arriva sempre dalla stessa parte." (And here, unfortunately, the hand is a nuisance because it always comes from the same side.) Because you are thinking about the visual system, but it is not.

So these cells are called place cells. And the Nobel Prize was given and in the news—you were probably not even born, or you were born ten years ago, you were younger—and they said, "Found the Nobel Prize because..." because people explained the GPS that is inside the brain. GPS is the global positioning system that you use with your mobile phones maybe to find whatever pizza or ice cream place, *gelateria, antica gelateria*, whatever, where you navigate. So your hippocampus is specifically helping you to navigate because it allows me to orient myself, and there is one hippocampal brain cell in my brain now that is firing and it was not firing when I was there. When I'm here another cell is firing. So at every moment I know where I am. It doesn't come for free. I need a few minutes to explore the surrounding because I need to create, to integrate information about visual, maybe other sensory modalities saying over there there is a lot of noise and maybe there is a very nice aroma of chocolate or perfume, here there is instead a bad smell. All the information integrated gives rise to these place cells and it's surprising, it's fantastic that you have neurons encoding space. The... okay I'm not saying the Euclidean space but it's... it's amazing. And to make some sort of circuits like this for place cells is a much more, it's a harder endeavor. If you have 20 minutes, there is a nice TED talk from a few years ago by Matt Wilson, who is a researcher at MIT, that is also telling you that when you sleep, you are replaying the sequence of activation of place cells. While the animal, or even myself, is creating, is moving, is navigating in the environment, different place cells are activated in sequence, and when I'm asleep, I'm replaying the sequence. I'm replaying the sequence of activation, because this is, maybe it's something that I have to consolidate. I have to sleep so that memories are consolidated. Spatial memories. I need to go there, because there might be some chocolate, or there was a nice smell, or a perfume or whatever, and I might need to concatenate, correlate all the place cells that finally led me to find here the chocolates, and I was really rewarded. I have to remember the street. If you use a mobile phone, you are probably not having this. It's very cool because when you are still, when the rat is still, or when it's in non-REM sleep, you have this replay of memories. It was particularly interesting, I don't remember whether it is in this talk, is a collaborator of Matt Wilson that I worked with, I collaborated with when I was in Belgium. The animal, still awake, not sleeping, was replaying the sequence and people could see the sequence of cells replaying, possibly because the animal had to plan ahead where it wanted to go. Extremely surprising because it deepens the understanding of the mechanistic functioning of the brain.

I'll show you another one that is in the entorhinal cortex. Same exercise. It's a little bit more complicated, but it's still related to space. And I wonder whether you see it. And this is particularly interesting. It is still for navigation, but you will see that it's interesting. Here it's a mouse. It's not a rat. And it's a smaller arena. And it's the same drill. I don't remember whether now there is food. There is no food. The wire that you see is because the electrodes are connected. And here you see again one small dot that is added to the image when and if the animal was there, there's a spot, and the recording electrode was detecting a nerve impulse. So clearly it's not one preferential spot, like a corner or like the front of the board here, of the desk. And after a few... this was... it's truly remarkable. It's a Nobel Prize and they got the Nobel Prize. It's amazing. For those of you who have some interest in science, or mathematics, or geometry, here it's surprising. I'm not, of course, it's not my field of research, but it's surprising that in the brain of an animal, you have some element of Euclidean geometry. Do you see what kind of, sort of, graphical, geometrical shape is resulting? So what I'm trying to delineate here is that it seems that these blocks of activity are not random, it seems to be at regular spots, and I could maybe build either hexagons or triangles. And maybe some of you, particularly if you had to renovate your kitchen or maybe your house, you know that in mathematics there is this idea that in order to cover a surface with a given geometry, I might have, depending on the geometry, if it's a triangle, if it's a hexagon, if it's a pentagon, I might have an easier or more difficult life to tessellate, *tassellazione* of a surface. And the triangle or the hexagons are the primitives that are able to tessellate, so to subdivide in domains, in regular domains, any surface, any flat surface, of course. That's why I kept saying a couple of times Euclidean space.

So these cells are called grid cells, for obvious reasons. And the grid, this is one cell. One cell has this tessellation, and another cell will have a tessellation that is might be rotated or scaled or translated, offset. It's what is sort of giving the underlying substrate for place cells. So it's only because you have these that you can get place cells. And again, you could, if you have grid cells, of course it will not be the retina, it will be some sort of space-effective domain, you could try to see how grid cells project to place cells in this sort of diagram, this sort of wiring diagram.

#### **Section 5: Network Activity *in vitro***

Something that we will also see is that electrophysiological signals can also be recorded from isolated portions of the brain. In this case, these are recordings done a few years ago in our lab, in which you don't have a rat, you don't have a mouse, you don't have a monkey. You have a bunch of cells that have been removed and digested enzymatically. They've been cultured. You probably know about cell culture. You've heard about cell culture. And these cells are plated on a chip, basically, like the one that I showed you last week. And these small things that you see here, small dots here, are the cell bodies. You don't see the dendrites and the axons because they are very, very highly packed. They are very tightly... the concentration of cells is very high. And because this is a microchip, these are metal electrodes. It's as if the chair where you are sitting is made of metal, like the example of an otherwise isolated antenna, an isolated conductor, and only here you have a metallization exposed, exposed to the electrolyte, or exposed to the bottom of some cells, like your bottoms. It's all very elegant, and when the cell is firing an action potential, it's not me with an electrode trying to pinch or to get closer to the cell; here the cell is sitting on my electrode. And for instance, in this case, the cell sitting on top of this electrode, or maybe nearby, was, again, producing over a time scale of maybe a fraction of a second, producing a series of nerve impulses. Something that might be capturing your eye is that this impulse, it seems to be a negative deflection. Negative deflection makes me interested because it's a... Let's say some of them seem to be smaller in amplitude. So here, maybe, it's like having a microphone in the room. Let me actually see if this guy is still recording. Yeah. So it's like having a microphone and having two people talking simultaneously, but one guy is a little bit further apart. So there is attenuation; there might be some attenuation like sounds, or like charge, or like electrical potential. You know, there is some sort of attenuation with distance. One over the distance, one over the square of the distance. We are going to see it and discuss it or refresh it later today. But it's interesting that if I have one neuron here, and I have one electrode, so let me connect this electrode to an amplifier. Just because I want to impress you that I'm an electronic engineer, so I remember how to make amplifiers. That's all. We don't need electronics for the moment. It's interesting to see that this electrode is recording a signal that is like a negative deflection. So this is zero. It's probably zero microvolts. And this is probably minus 100 microvolts. So it's very, very tiny. You need a big amplifier to analyze it.

In solution, although we are going to discuss it, in solution you have, as you probably know, you have ions. And these ions can be positively and negatively charged. In the electrode, if this is made, say, this electrode is made of platinum and this cable here is made of copper, Cu is copper, right? Okay, so here you probably know that the charge carriers are electrons. Fine, okay, but it's interesting that here ions, say for instance you might have sodium ions and chloride ions, or you might have calcium. Okay, calcium will have double valency, but you might have positive and negative ions. Here the antenna is recording a signal that is negative. Why would it be negative? Well, why should this part of space be negative? Think of it. We are going to slowly approach this apparent mystery. It must be something about the distribution of charge inside and outside in general, and during when the neuron is excited and it emits a pulse. It's very interesting because it's the same language that you might have been seeing while studying semiconductors. In semiconductors, you have two charge carriers. One is the electron, and the other one, you know what it is? Have you ever studied silicon? *Lacune*. Holes. Yeah. So, it's not so different. You have positively and negatively charged carriers, and the analogies are many, so many, that even the pH, the acidity of a solution, that means if you have some proton, some H+, also because water is dissociated, so if you have H+, if you measure this, it's a measure of pH. There is some sort of equivalent in the semiconductor world. So the analogies... so at the beginning of last hour, because of the suggestion by your colleague, I mentioned that in terms of spatial scale, nanomaterials, nanotechnologies are even smaller, if not comparable, to biological processes. Well, it turns out we have even the electronics that is maybe speaking some language that we are used to.

I'm showing you this because even in this very simplified circuit, you have some sort of emerging behavior. Different spots here, different dots are from different electrodes. Here, here, and here we have 60 of these electrodes indicating when in time there is one of these peaks at that electrode. So, electrode number 1, number 2, number 3, number 60. And time is in this direction, and what you actually see here that seems to look like fireworks, is the top view of an 8x8 array of microelectrodes, similar to the one that you held in your hands last week. And when there is a small explosion, it's because there is a small signal, like this. And you see that just by eye, looking here, there are situations like now where the activity is irregular, asynchronous, and epochs in which the activity is almost synchronous everywhere. Oh, and there it seems as if it's not tired. There is not a lot of spontaneous activity now, then it started again. And here in this other representation, this synchronized activity is represented by stripes. What I found interesting is at this point, you probably noticed that immediately after, there is fatigue. It's as if things get tired, which is what I mentioned before, knocking and saying, if I ask this population to fire a lot of action potentials, a lot of nerve impulses, after a while they will get exhausted. So they might need a few milliseconds to recover, which is... this is one stupid example, but I hope it will stick. It's disgusting. If you have these animals, the llama, you know that llamas spit. If you ask the llama to spit repeatedly, say 20 spits per second, after a while the llama will not have any more saliva in its mouth, so it will not be able to spit. But if you give it time, it will replenish its reserves of saliva. Maybe here is the same thing, and citing Professor Zoli's classes, maybe in the synapse that maybe he has shown or maybe not, the vesicles containing neurotransmitters, maybe they got depleted. So all the neurotransmitter was released and they got empty. So even if you ask, "Okay, release, release,"... All the other comparisons with urinary functions and other things will not be very elegant, so I'm sticking with a llama spitting, although it's a stupid comparison.

So, the fact that you have a network in a dish is hinting at the fact that you could study, in a reduced preparation, signals and how the signals are organized when you have a circuit, which is very interesting, very convenient, besides what I mentioned last week, that you could maybe build some sort of biological computer by having neurons in a dish, not anymore in the brain of a living animal.

#### **Section 6: Macroscopic Signals: Electroencephalography (EEG)**

Instead of this microscopic recording with this microelectrode array, probably you're familiar with a more mesoscopic, macroscopic recording of the electrical activity, which I wanted to do, but in class I wanted to demonstrate but it's not really possible because of the noise. Later, I'll tell you why last time I had a lot of noise, but that's for another time. And this is called the electroencephalogram, and it's due to the observation from Hans Berger, that was from the last century, or the 19th century... well, the 20th century, in which by having an electrode, first he did it in a dog, in dogs, he had an electrode on the scalp, so very far from the actual brain. So not only you have hair, skin, bone, and then below you have membranes like the dura mater, the pia mater, so you have a lot of stuff before you start having neurons. But what he could observe is, this is one of the original traces, that you have electrical signals that are changing over time. So you probably are familiar with the EEG as a way to reveal rhythms. And what does it mean? Why? Okay, yeah, I get it that compared to what I did before or what Hubel and Wiesel did, they had one microphone and the microphone was in the mouth of one neuron, it was so close. And this is similar, more similar to somebody sitting outside the room. Okay, now you're very quiet and I'm grateful for this. But if we were all talking and chatting, some people, somebody from the outside of the room, will simply hear some rumble. They would not be able to distinguish individual voices, they will actually hear the summated effect. Maybe even attenuated because of the distance. Like neurons are attenuated because the electrode is a surface skin electrode. And because of a lot of noise. So, yeah, it's a very sloppy, very poorly characterized signal. But it might be worth understanding or trying to understand a little bit because this is what in diagnostics people use, for instance, to predict whether you have some disorder of excitability like epilepsy or whether you have some sleep disorder or whether you have some sort of connectivity disorder. Schizophrenia, autism, would maybe reveal their signature on EEG. So for understanding first principles, forget it, it's too broad. It's actually, I want to speak with each of you to understand what you're saying, but if you want to simply classify as healthy or diseased, go for it, because people accumulated more than 100 years of experience for understanding whether this is normal or this is pathological.

So this is electroencephalography and we will sort of slightly go around, I'll tell you what it is, and it's for what I consider to be more like a classification. So you put the electrodes, hopefully you put the electrodes always in the same position, because hopefully you want maybe to try to compare different patients, different experiments, different measurements from different doctors, different people, different hospitals, different countries. So you may want to have a convention, and it's purely a convention, there is nothing to understand. In fact, I'm not going to tell you about this convention. And it's what you end up with, what people did, was simply observing. Okay, so the guy is sleeping. Oh, the guy is keeping his or her eyes open. Or no, the person is with eyes closed. Or the person or the animal, the rat, or whatever, is running or is staying still. And they could see that in different brain states, which I don't know if they are really brain states, they are conditions that are easy to classify, to recognize behaviorally, because if I think about my childhood now, how can you really be sure that I'm thinking of my child? If I'm snoring and sleeping, maybe you can say, "Okay, the guy is sleeping." So you characterize, you classify, it's purely a categorization. There is no understanding, but you can annotate rhythms based on their frequency. So if it's slow, like... particularly today I was watching a YouTube video where beta and alpha apparently are enhanced by practitioners of mindfulness. If you sit and you focus on your breath, your frequency content or your waves in the cortex of the beta band or alpha band, that means in the frequency component of part of your spectrum of your EEG, beta and alpha are higher than when you are instead doing nothing, you are scrolling Instagram or TikTok. Instead, if you are engaged in sleep, then your activity slows down. It's sort of getting so-called theta rhythm, or even deep sleep with delta and even slower. And people now start a little bit to understand, okay, but at the level of individual nodes. So, one node, what does it do when it sleeps? Does it also oscillate four times per second? Does it fire one pulse once a second? And the answer is yes. But it's very peculiar because all the nodes in the cortex are roughly doing the same stuff. So somebody sitting outside, if we were all clapping our hands with a rhythm, they would probably be able to get at least the rhythm, if we are all synchronized. If we are... probably you have experience, when you go to a theater and you clap, you're not synchronized with your peers, unless the singer or whoever is asking you to do so, is imposing some pacemaking. And if there is randomness, from the outside, you will actually hear no rhythm, noise. If instead everybody is synchronized, then outside, so the EEG amplitude will record some sort of oscillation. So, yes, but they also need to be synchronous, like in vitro those stripes that I showed you in a dish, in a culture dish.

### **Part 5: Pathological Brain Activity: Epilepsy**

#### **Section 1: The Penfield Homunculus and Seizures**

Have you ever heard of the Penfield homunculus? Before the break, I would like to know whether you know what the sensory or motor homunculus is. Some of you are nodding. Just because in a moment I will discuss with you what happens when an EEG will actually see this, when the rhythms of the brain, so the signals that you can detect by EEG, they go completely crazy. They get synchronized, and when they get synchronized... Ah, I spoiled it. Okay. When they get synchronized, they get synchronized across in space. So they're actually invading the entire cortex. And the question is, this cortical homunculus, okay, I spoiled it, is where in the sensory area of the cortex—I think here is sensory and here is motor. Yeah. So, in different areas of the cortex, you have different spots, different surfaces of the cortex, devoted to different body parts. Both in terms of sensation, so tickling, or in terms of movement. And one question that I have for you before the break is: Do you know why hands are deformed? Or even the lips, both for the sensory and the motor, and the motor homunculus, which is a sort of graphical representation of what this mapping is. And Penfield is a neurosurgeon that was the first to, during surgery, neurosurgery, start stimulating the sensory cortex of an awake patient, and the patient was saying, "Yeah, you're touching me on my hand." "I know, I'm just electrically stimulating one part of your somatosensory cortex." Or, probably in an anesthetized patient, saying to the patient, "Why are you twitching your finger?" "I don't know, it's not me, it's not my voluntary control." "Yeah, don't worry, it's the neurosurgeon that is stimulating electrically with a small electrical pulse in the exact same area where your finger is mapped." So we have this map, and like for retinotopy, it's some sort of deformation. I would love if you could think of why hands are over-represented and also lips and tongue. 30 seconds, you have any idea? It's about evolution. Why? Why? Why? Sensory feedback, and we also have to have a very... not only piano players, but also us. We need to, in order to be dexterous, to be skilled with hands, with movements, we need to have big hardware. And the lips, I think, not for language, but because of food. So you want to know if it's very hot or if it's a scorpion. It's an interesting thing. I have to read if it's about... I don't think it's about... because in primates, non-speaking primates, you have the same. You have the same deformation. But it's definitely related to survival. So we'll stop for 10 minutes. And I'll change the microphone battery. Thank you. Which is what? But thank you. "computer vision e in generale in image processing esistono dei filtri, se avete fatto un corso di soluzione di reti neurali la parola 'convoluzione' vuol dire applicare un filtro lineare all'immagine. Quello che vi ho detto è per fare il detector di edge è applicare un filtro che sia una derivata spaziale in una certa direzione e nella direzione opposta e questo è un kernel. Questo kernel non lo so perché sono ignorante se se lo fanno lo fanno questo kernel, questo kernel è un filtro spaziale che è esattamente il circuito che avete implementato e molto probabilmente è il finale della..." (In computer vision and in general in image processing there are filters. If you have done a course on neural networks, the word 'convolution' means applying a linear filter to the image. What I told you to do to make an edge detector is to apply a filter that is a spatial derivative in a certain direction and in the opposite direction, and this is a kernel. I don't know, because I'm ignorant, if they do it, they do this kernel. This kernel is a spatial filter that is exactly the circuit that you have implemented and very probably it's the final part of the...) Thank you. I think this. And you can finish every 45 or... Okay, so other two blends of topics or contexts that I think might be relevant when you study electrophysiological signals, particularly pathological signals, particularly something that, as I said, electroencephalography would reveal as a pathological signal: ultra-synchronized transients known as epilepsy. And I will show you a couple of videos without omitting the so-called graphic part, the part that will be maybe disturbing to some of you. But I wanted to just evoke the story of the homunculus because maybe you already know that different spots of your sensory cortex or motor cortex are encoding for different areas in the world. Well, the world would be the skin or the motor action. So also in this case, by the way, you can talk about receptive fields. The receptive field would be an area on my skin that would be, if stimulated in some way, mechanically, thermally, with pain, then I would have neurons in the corresponding cortex activated by it. But what I wanted only to refresh is that you know that you have some parts that would be, if you have electrical activity here, maybe stimulated by an electrode or maybe by some crazy wave of synchronous activity that gets generated and it spreads pathologically out over the whole cortex, maybe invading here would give the impression that something is touching your leg, even if you don't have anything. And similarly, if you have activation, again, by an electrode, by somebody like Penfield stimulating like a neurosurgeon, or by a wave of synchronous pathological activity in your face, in the motor part of your face, maybe you will contract both, you will extend both muscles, and you will start having some motor actions that are clearly highly unphysiological. And from the behavioral point of view, would not be normal, would not be conventional, would not be something that you're used to. Because normally, say for some motor actions, you're contracting only one muscle and not both. You would contract the extensor or the contractor, but not both at the same time. Okay, you answered: "And if a wave of abnormal synchronous electrical activity..." further you understand that we could experience sensory sensations and even motor actions. And okay, the story about how it could propagate from one spot to the next... I kept drawing some axons and synapses and another neuron and a neuron with another axon, so it may not be completely impossible to understand that if the connection is for doing some computation, it is so intricate, and maybe just by chance as a side effect, it's a system that can be very easily recruited for propagating pathological electrical activity. This is a nice video that you probably have been, I hope you have been seeing some variations on, in which if you have a set of metronomes and you are having some way to couple them, not by, in this case, by electrical synapses, by connections, but some sort of reading that is propagating vibrations and effectively coupling them, after a while, the metronomes get synchronized. So if you have a system that is highly densely connected and something goes wrong, it could explode, because all the elements could get synchronized, unless you remove some sort of medium for connectivity, for the spread of activity, for connectivity. Anti-epileptic drugs either slow down the pacemaker, they make all the neurons fire a little bit less, or they try to interrupt connections. And clearly, I hope your objection will be: "Hey, wait a minute, the connections are there for me to talk, to understand, to reason, to love, to dream, so if you interfere chemically, maybe I will have side effects." And this is indeed the case. So maybe in a near future, there are already many clinical trials, you will not have anymore a pill that is indiscriminately shutting down all the neurons. You will have a small brain pacemaker that when a sudden abrupt rise of synchrony is occurring, will try to desynchronize, like in this case it would be... could be somebody, at some point, shaking this, so that the metronomes that got synchronized would not be anymore synchronous.

#### **Section 2: Epilepsy as a Disorder of Hypersynchrony**

So I'm talking about these abnormal rhythms and synchronization. They are relevant and typically very commonly described and measured by EEG, by electroencephalography. And it's interesting for me to just to mention, if you're not already familiar, epilepsy is a collection of many disorders that result in this sudden synchronized activity. So the seizure, *convulsione epilettica*, is just a symptom and not always can be treated by drugs. So one out of three people are drug-resistant, unfortunately. And this involves seizures, and I will show you a couple of types of seizures, which are sudden and excessive electrical discharges of the central nervous system neurons. And obviously because of the homunculus, of the Penfield homunculus, and not only that, because where is my sense of religion? Where is my sense? Where is my awareness? Where are my breath centers? It's not only in the cortex, but for the cortex and the homunculus it's easier to find. You have unexpected changes in behavior, in motor functions, in sensation and in consciousness. Whatever it is to be aware, to be conscious, to be able to receive information and react appropriately must be related to electrical activity. Unless you believe in the soul, but that's a different story. I don't. So if you have electrical activity that goes crazy, you might affect, not necessarily, but you could also affect consciousness. And it's quite frequent, 1% of the population. There is also a set of epilepsies that appear in the pediatric age, and they tend to disappear. So I'm not asking if, but it could be that some of you, as a kid, could have had one seizure. And because of traumatic injury, you could even experience, I hope not, but in the future, all of us could experience a seizure. Even in Alzheimer's, in dementia, there are seizures. There is some sort of excitability disorder. So a disorder of the electrical state of neurons.

So these seizures are typical events that last a few minutes, and if they don't persist too long, they do not cause persistent damage. For the moment, we would not understand why there should be persistent damage. You could maybe, by some analogy with electronics, you would say, if my computer would be electrocuted, so there would be some sudden electrical activity in all the parts of my laptop, probably it will be fried. Some component will be broken, mechanically or electrically. It will be burned. You don't have heat in the brain. You have glutamate, which is the excitatory neurotransmitter, which nobody really knows why this is the case, it's also cytotoxic. So it's toxic to the cell. Cytology is the study of the cell. So cytotoxic is something that would kill the cell. So if you have a lot of glutamate release, cells start to undergo cell death, apoptosis. And despite in the past, epilepsy was associated with stupidity, to witchcraft. People were burning, so people were burned alive because they were thought to be witches or wizards, just because of epilepsy, and there is no relationship to intelligence or to violence. There is still a societal stigma that if you, I hope that maybe you know somebody suffering from epilepsy, yeah, they're fine. And there are two kinds. I will show you an example of petit mal and grand mal. The petit mal, they are also called absence seizures. Well, this one I will not show you the video. And you will see in a moment why they are called absence, depending if it's French or not. Instead, the grand mal are more graphic to see and in both cases consciousness is compromised. There are other seizures that instead are not involving... consciousness is not compromised. This is a typical EEG plot, different electrodes placed as I told you conventionally in different places of the skull, they record very large, so large amplitude and also fast oscillations, which is interesting that they get large, while before they were not large. And the comparison, it was a stupid comparison of us clapping our hands, synchronously or not synchronously, and somebody from outside the door, doing some sort of average of the sounds, would actually hear very prominently the bang of us clapping if we are synchronous, and not really large, in that case it would be auditory sound pressure, very strong when we are not synchronous. It's the same phenomenon, and I have another cartoon to show to you, where here we don't have... we have asynchronous activity. Millions are oscillating, they are firing, but they are firing in a scrambled way. So there is no summation, no big build-up. If instead they do, and they do everything... There is probably cell number two that started going crazy before, and the others are maybe following. How would you know that? Maybe some signal processing technique, like cross-correlation. If you ever played with signal processing, it would maybe give you, it's a linear technique of course, it would give you some hints about how delayed one signal is to the other one. Cross-correlation means that you quantify similarity, and it could be similarity but not at the exact same moment, so isochronous, but with some phase shift. And indeed, you could reveal that, say, electrode number two is earlier, the signal from electrode number two starts earlier. But okay, just to give you a glimpse that what you studied, or at least what some of you studied in your previous years, is very useful. By the way, even trigonometry, but we'll see that another time.

So I'll show you now a focal, which means it's not generalized, it's not invading the entire cortex, it's only focal. And this young kid, you probably can guess where he has the focus of the epilepsy. The guy is without... he's contracting, moving the mouth, so you probably can tell me which part of the cortex in the Penfield homunculus this focus is located. At least you can tell me whether it's the motor or sensory cortex. This should be easy. Motor. So it's a motor symptom. And obviously it's likely to be related. It's around here. Not that necessarily it's always easy to say, "Ah, yeah, I see." And therefore you do it with EEG, showing where it is located. And in this case it doesn't spread everywhere. It's... you know, it's very easy to understand something, something that went wrong with the population of neurons that started to oscillate at the same frequency as the motor symptoms. And something interesting is that it's not in this case, it's not spreading, although there are connections. For instance, there are connections between the motor and sensory areas. It's not spreading, it's not invading, luckily for this guy, it's not invading the entire cortex. So in this case consciousness is not affected, it's unilateral, it's localized. Of course, it's unilateral, it's only in the left part of the face, in the motor areas, so in the cortex you have a representation of all motor and sensory areas of the body. And it's intermittent, and the fact that it's intermittent has something to do with neurons, and we will see later on when we discuss excitability. Why would a nerve cell be inherently starting to oscillate? Why is it an oscillator? And so this is clearly here, I'm not talking about one neuron, it's probably going to be millions of neurons nearby sitting here and being faulty for some reason. Maybe they got too hyper-connected. Maybe there is some fault in the genetics and when the neurons are firing, maybe some positive ions are accumulating too much and they are not able to diffuse away, like ink in a glass of water that would diffuse away. Maybe there is something wrong with, technically it's called ionic buffering, that means removing ions that are in excess, and this movement in the population starts to go crazy.

I'll show you now, it's quite... it's a little bit dramatic, but not as dramatic as a tonic-clonic seizure that I'm not showing to you, but if you're curious, have a look on YouTube. It's not... the person is not in pain during the seizure. Of course it looks to you as very unnatural. So it's not a surprise that people thought, "Oh, it's the devil that is possessing this person." But the consciousness of the person is gone. So clearly, if it's your brother, your boyfriend, it has an emotional impact, but the person is not suffering. So you could look at those videos on YouTube where people are showing them to say, "I'm not possessed by the devil, I'm not more violent, I'm suffering from a disorder of excitability." Here, it's typically the absence seizure. They are generalized, so consciousness is gone. It's happening several times a day, so they can be very disruptive for kids that are learning at school. They typically go away with puberty, so some sort of reorganization of the cortex and the thalamus is happening with age. This is known, so we know that the development of the nervous system in humans is continuing during adolescence, and I think up to 18, 20 years of age. And if you record the EEG, it's not this very strong, high-amplitude, ultra-synchronized, crazy EEG; it has a very peculiar peak that is called a spike, although it's not a spike like in an action potential in a nerve impulse, it's visually a peak and a wave. So it's a small needle and then a wave. Needle-wave, spike-wave, spike-wave at a very specific frequency, 3 hertz. When a neurologist, an expert in reading EEG, looks at this, they immediately say, "The thalamus is involved and this is an absence seizure." The thalamus, as I said, is the station that is in between, that is connecting sensory information and relaying it to the cortex. So you could probably understand that maybe the connections are not only in one direction; there is feedback, like everywhere in the brain, there is almost always feedback. So you have basically a station that is, just by some pathological state... If some focal epilepsy starts here, it can be recruited and it can spread the activity everywhere. Okay, the point is not relevant. It's only that the father is calling him again and again. In a moment it starts and he's blanking. He's not there anymore. Here it starts. And he does not have any memory, any recollection of what's happening. For him, time was moved forward by a few seconds. Now it's back. Imagine if you're at school, and now it starts again. Even with your accent... "did she send me the whole thing when I was absent?" The twitching of the eyes is also another interesting thing. It's gone. So this is quite dramatic and some of you told me about your interest in consciousness. Well, it seems that the thalamus and the fact that the cortex is not completely synchronized and the thalamus is remaining as a relay station for sensory information and it's not going crazy like in this case, seems to be relevant. So here consciousness is gone and it's like a switch: on-off, on-off. So I don't know what consciousness is, nobody knows it. Only a little bit we start understanding it, and the route of looking at pathologies like coma, locked-in syndrome or anesthesia or some forms of epilepsy are relevant for objective information, also with the idea of treating, for therapy, of course, patients.

So this is an example of a generalized seizure. Again, it starts in one specific area. I really don't care about the positioning of the electrodes. As I said, this is a convention. You can learn it, and maybe after a couple of weeks you will forget it. Knowing that it's a convention might give you some hints that we don't really know. We know that if we do this always in the same way, we can compare it to the literature and to books, which is precious. So an experienced neurologist would say that this was a sort of event that looked funny, and this is the start of the seizure. What happens normally, and you will probably understand why, after having been confronted with the fact that you have the Penfield homunculus somewhere, and also that the brain is responsible for cognition, thoughts, emotions, memory, dreams, hopes, etc., smell, etc., it's all in the electrical activity of the cells. You can probably understand that at this stage, a few tenths of seconds, a few seconds before the loss of consciousness, patients are reporting the so-called aura. And typically they start responding, saying, "Okay, something is wrong. I start smelling something that is funny, that it's not real, it's not authentic, it's not real." It's clearly not real. Let's say there is nothing in the world that smells. And there are signals that are normally not compatible with actual sensory things because the world smells differently. If my olfactory cortex is activating synchronously, it starts to get activated in a synchronous way, maybe this does not correlate to any chocolate, any Belgian chocolate, but not even any food. Or I will start to feel, to have visual hallucinations. Again, we know that in the visual cortex you have cells that start to be activated if you have, in the world, light stimuli with orientation. So there is no surprise that maybe sometimes you can see a geometrical pattern. There is a nice book by... Ah, damn. He's a very famous neurologist. He died a few years ago. He was the author of *Awakenings*. It was a famous movie with Robin Williams. And he was reporting about hallucinations. In his case, because he was blind, but in general about geometrical shapes. Can you help me? Do you know the guy? No, you should read him. He's a very famous... I think he won the Pulitzer Prize for the book. So he was a scientist, a medical doctor, but he was also a very talented writer. Oliver Sacks. Oliver Sacks. Thank you. Thanks. Please believe me, he's a fantastic guy. Very humble, and he died recently. So, no surprise that you could see during the aura this, and report geometrical patterns. Now we know that you have cells that are encoding for orientations, etc.

At some point you have the tonic stage in which the motor cortex is invaded by... so consciousness is gone because you are, anyway, all the cortex is doing the same thing. And it's not a big surprise that people are reported, if you look at the movies, at the videos on YouTube, people obviously fall on the ground, this is the risk of injury, particularly if they are driving a car or flying a plane, these are the risks. Not necessarily the seizure per se, unless it happens very frequently. So there is a co-contraction of all the muscles and it starts progressively and clearly it doesn't look real, it doesn't look normal, and of course it's not normal. And something that was always capturing my attention is the so-called epileptic cry. If all muscles are contracted, it's also the muscles of the chest for respiration. So if I have air in my lungs, it gets extruded and if my epiglottis is closed, I will have some sort of sound. And of course, people around will get impressed, but technically it's just the muscles that are all contracting, because the entire motor cortex is invaded by this synchronized activity. And then after this tonic phase, it starts the clonic phase, so some sort of rhythm that is activating muscles, all the actuators, so extensors and contractors, all the pairs of muscles that are allowing movements, start to oscillate. And so the patient is typically at the beginning after a tonic phase, has a clonic phase. Many videos of dogs, epileptic dogs, are on the internet, unfortunately. And you would be surprised that epilepsy or neurological disorders in animals are in general advancing, even psychiatric disorders, depression, schizophrenia, are advancing our knowledge on the same diseases in humans. And as a side effect, treatments for the animals are getting better and better. This was sort of inspiring. And here we have, again, that maybe it starts with a focus, maybe it involves the thalamus as a way to relay pathological activity everywhere. And so this is sort of... so it can start, okay, I should have said, it could start in the thalamus and spread, or it can start somewhere and involve the thalamus and spread everywhere. This is probably the future in which either a subdural, sub, below the dura, the dura mater, or intracortically... so, ah, sorry, we're done. Or DBS, this is a DBS array of microelectrodes, this is a surface subdural, they could be maybe wireless, but wireless is not, okay, it's striking, it's cool, but it's not particularly mind-blowing. The mind-blowing thing would be that if you have a brain pacemaker that is able to interfere, maybe you can disrupt synchronization. With a big electrical pulse, you would scramble things. It would be as if you start making a mess, you start talking. You're too polite, too gentle and too silent, so it doesn't happen. If I start shouting, maybe you will get, for a moment, you will get shocked by my reaction. So if there are neurons, maybe I can shock them and they respond and later on they will be tired. For a few milliseconds, I showed you, real neurons are getting tired, they are adapting, so maybe I can desynchronize a population of neurons going crazy by giving them a sort of reset signal. And there are some of these devices in clinical trials, they are not yet on the market.

### **Part 6: The Biophysical Origins of Neural Signals**

#### **Section 1: The Origin of the EEG Signal**

Now, what is the origin of EEG? We are getting a little bit closer during the course, particularly during the second half of the course, but roughly I can tell you that the EEG, already now at the level of this cartoon, is related to the activity of one kind of cell, those that are my favorites, the pyramidal cells. Rita Levi-Montalcini, in her memories, was saying that on the microscope, looking at different brain sections, so, resected brain slices of maybe humans or chickens or rats, whatever, she was impressed by looking at all of them within the cortex. And this is actually quite impressive. No matter how many times you do the experiments, you do the preparation, the cortex looks always the same with all the pyramidal cells aligned like this. So, this is where the hairs are. And this is where the white matter is in the ventral part. Here is the dorsal part: the hair, the bone, the dura mater, and the pia mater. So they are all aligned in this way. She actually said that they resembled pilgrims walking along lines during a pilgrimage. Okay, it stuck in my brain and I wanted to tell you. And it's because these guys are aligned, they are aligned as electrical dipoles. Maybe you're familiar with magnetic dipoles, north and south. Sort of the same thing, although it's not magnetic forces or magnetic phenomena here. Maybe under some circumstances that we will see, the soma will get charged, say, positively. I'm talking about outside. And the dendrites will be charged negatively. And so this separation of charge will act as a dipole, and because they are all aligned in the same way, all the electric fields, vector fields, will summate. And if you have an electrode here, you will sense it.

If you are like me, you probably got extremely disappointed, saying, "Okay, yes, these cells represent the majority of the cells in the cortex. But the brain is not only the cortex. What about the thalamus? What about the basal ganglia? What about the base of the encephalon? The cerebellum. Who cares about the cortex?" Yes, it's probably evolutionarily the most interesting part. It's probably why we are human, because of our cortex... But come on, the EEG is only about one spot of the brain? Not only the surface, only 80% of cells, all the cells that have this geometry. What about all the other cells? There are many other cells that are also excitatory, and there are many inhibitory cells, which are here, and they are all making a very dense network. They don't count, they don't play any role for the EEG, because their geometry is not aligned, and their electric fields cancel out. Which to me is depressing, because it says, "Okay, so EEG may give you some information, but it's not the golden standard." On the other hand, this is the only thing that we have. Unless you go invasive, but ethically, unless you need to have some sort of implant, you cannot look at the brain invasively. Functional magnetic resonance has a very sloppy temporal resolution, and spatially, you don't really see the electrical activity; you see the blood oxygenation level, which is indirect. It's metabolic, it's delayed, and it's averaged, and it may have nothing to do with the neurons. So we will try to understand not the entire EEG, but at least how the so-called extracellular fields can be studied, given the morphology of a cell, and what happens for the cell to have here positively charged ions outside and far apart from the apical dendrite, negatively charged ions. This is where we can start understanding, and we will call this local electrical phenomenon, we will call it local electric field, or local field electrical potential, local field potential, LFP, instead of EEG which clearly involves a mess of the entire block of cortex that is below it. You probably know that the cortex, particularly the human cortex, is not flat. It's constantly a sequence of gyri and sulci. It's not flat. The cortex of a rabbit is flat. The cortex of a human, probably because we had such a large growing surface extended, has to be packed and folded. Like a piece of paper, I do it for the sake of science, like a piece of paper in order to have the same surface but occupying a smaller volume. Whoever will forgive me.

So this is a cartoon that I promised for only this cell. Okay, I'm basically neglecting all the other interesting interneurons, inhibitory neurons and other excitatory neurons that are not shaped like this for dipoles. And here you probably understand why roughly the same activity... So this is very stylized. You don't see any pulse, like I told you the neurons are emitting those pulses. But if you allow this poetic license, then here you have that this activity is very different from neuron number one to neuron number two to neuron number three. So if you do the arithmetic average, the sum, you have the EEG on a first approximation, and you see that maybe you have, as a result, a small amplitude, high frequency signal. Small amplitude because it's never one transient... okay, here this is one big transient, but the other big transient for the other cell starts not in the same spot, it starts here, and this one has it here, and this one has it here. So they're not synchronous, so they don't sum up. So, amplitudes are small and they are at high frequency just purely as a result of this arithmetic summation. Not because the individual cells were firing or were oscillating at high frequency. Simply because of phase differences. And when they are synchronized, you actually see it and you have large amplitude, slow frequencies. These words of "large amplitude, slow EEG" or "desynchronized EEG, small amplitudes, fast frequencies" are what neurologists talk about all the time, because this is sort of their stereotypical language that they use qualitatively to refer to maybe some state, or learning state, that we don't understand. We understand partly why this happens and how it can be treated, if they're really synchronous or not synchronous.

#### **Section 2: The Need for a Deeper Understanding**

I'm done with this long introduction, calling for bioengineering and neuroengineering to actually develop an understanding. So it's not that we want to, for the sake of science, understand the origin of the EEG and understand what happens or why, in this case it was a microscopic EEG, why you get a negative signal and then you get maybe a small positive bump. Why? I want to do that because if I understand slightly what happens, maybe I can design that brain pacemaker to interfere with epilepsy better, or I can have some brain-machine interface based on EEG, like most of the brain-computer interfaces nowadays, for people that do not have any invasive implant, work better. Today they are not suboptimal. However, it's a mess to understand, and it's not just the algebraic sum. So it's more than this, and it's very complicated because these cells are electrical devices. So the local field potential, that is what we are going to investigate a little bit. EEG and even the magnetic counterpart, MEG, are involved, and they are still not completely understood. This is a computer simulation of one guy and we are going to use... So this is from one of the authors of the book that I recommended for this course. And right now in the simulation he is activating only the soma. And the neuron here becomes red and the EEG, the simulated EEG or local field potential, shows a positive deflection. Let me see again. So, when you only have inputs arriving in the basal dendrites, then the local field potential starts to be positive, depending on which depth your electrode is at. If the inputs are arriving in the periphery, in the apical dendrites, you actually see it's the exact opposite. And if the input arrives everywhere, in a moment, for the simulation, the cells will start firing and communicating and getting bright, whatever. You almost record nothing. So, the naive expectation that on the surface, with this simulated output, whenever you see a positive bump, it means that you have one or the other activation, is wrong. It depends on the activation, what caused the activation, and where the synaptic inputs impinged and activated the compartments. Now it doesn't make sense, I only want to show it so that we can understand a little bit better. And the way to understand it involves understanding, first of all, that neurons are not points; they are not systems that are concentrated in one point, although the point-neuron approximation is useful and we will use it. So neurons are distributed in space, like maybe a small cable and a ball, which is the soma. I'm particularly using the word "cable" because I'm a geek and I told you about my interest for Morse code. In the late 19th century, Lord Kelvin, the same guy famous for thermodynamics, wrote a mathematical equation for submarine electrical cables, bringing telegraphic signals, Morse code signals, under the ocean, because they were difficult to design or difficult to understand the variations of signals that are propagating through such long cables. Believe it or not, the exact same equation, the cable equation, will be used in this course to try to make sense of this local field potential. And it's surprising that it's the same equation as for an electrical cable. In this case, it's a biological cable. So the key point is, it's not a point, it's distributed in space, and it matters where and how the electrical activity of these cells is behaving. Right now it doesn't make sense.

#### **Section 3: Biophysical and Mathematical Preliminaries**

I'm going now to start with light preliminaries. So we'll finish in five minutes and then we have the last hour. It's going to be light. I'm going to refresh some concepts from electrostatics and biophysics. Do you have questions so far? I invite you once more, if you have any questions, to come to me, to contact me. I don't care about repeating things over and over for you or giving you additional explanations of material. If you don't speak, I cannot deal with it. So my suggestion would be to start studying about these topics throughout the course. You don't necessarily need to do the exam in the first session in January, but do it. Because you have me engaged and active. Not that I go away in the second semester, I'm still here in Modena. But maybe we can refer and count on these, maybe it will work or will not, on the Teams chat that you could use as a forum to ask questions. And maybe some of your community will say, "I found this analogy useful." The one of the llama spitting was disgusting and was not very useful. But these other analogies helped me understand it. So please, count on me.

So let me switch to preliminaries and then we'll break. And for this part the slides are already in the repository; I posted them this morning. You could refer if you want to these two chapters in this book, particularly *Cellular Biophysics* and *Foundations of Cellular Neurophysiology*. I don't know whether all these books are... at least I know that this should be in the library, this one should also be in the library. If not, let me know and I'll ask them to buy it. And for no reason, look at... well, you could even consider buying some of these books. The idea is that they are supporting your studying and understanding. It's not necessarily that you will see here verbatim, word by word, what I'm saying. I try to make your life even simpler, even taking it and refreshing something that you probably already studied extensively in high school or during the first couple of years of your bachelor, at least the first year of bachelor in physics. And there are these four concepts. The first one is purely a convention, and I would like to... it's a nomenclature thing, and I would like to make, because, sorry, explaining it will give me the possibility to clarify some concepts. So, physicists normally always talk about the density of particles in space. Chemists talk about concentrations of a solute in a solvent. It's the same thing, it's a matter of jargon, and I will demonstrate it to you. Second, I would like to, since we have to talk about electrical potential and charges, I have maybe to refresh basic electrostatics. So it's not Maxwell's equations, eh? Don't worry. It's maybe Coulomb's force and what is the potential of a force? What is the electrostatic potential? Third is something that you may or may not have heard of. It's mobility. I need to describe the ions that we will start looking at. I need to understand and to give a number to possibly measure if a fat ion swimming in a solution in the aqueous medium will encounter more resistance than a slim ion. I would like to give a number. This number I call it mobility, which is not particularly original. So the mobility of a particle in a fluid, in an aqueous solution. And fourth, again, this is another definition in the sense that it's me defining what I would love to describe. It's a flux or flow of particles in a fluid. Particularly because I want to understand whether maybe ions are going inside or outside or they go away. How do they work? How does it work? Because so far, particularly for electromagnetism, I know about forces. Okay, you have a particle, and maybe you are in an electric field, I know what force it is. But I want to understand how these things move. And to do that, it's very convenient to talk about flux. Flux is the biochemist's word for current. Those are going to be electrical currents. Well, strictly speaking, it's a current density, because it's per unit of area, per unit of cross-section. I imagine a river where you have water flowing, but this is nothing else than current. So electrical current, ionic current, this is resistance, electrical resistance, but I call it mobility, and all the rest are definitions or fundamental laws of nature.

And I'm going to use mathematics, like it or not. Okay, Feynman was even saying that it allows us to reason. So it's not only a language that is very precise, but per se allows us to make inferences, allows us to make discoveries. And it's true, if I can write something in mathematical terms, maybe I can then shut down my brain, shut down my understanding, and simply crunch equations, and I will derive consequences. And of course, then I go back to the experiment to see whether it works. Of course, I'm not claiming that you will have to remove your intuition. All my efforts, today and in the coming weeks, is to try to tickle both your mathematical preferences as well as your physical intuition. I hope that you will roughly feel that you understand in your stomach, and you can replicate it with a pen and paper on the blackboard with chalk. And okay, so this is a sentence that I already told you. Nature speaks the language of math, and it's beautiful. It's a beautiful language, so maybe we can try to use the same language. This guy was a Nobel Prize winner for quantum mechanics, was a very prolific author of books, of science dissemination books. Maybe you know this guy; he was playing bongos and was also very fond of opening locks or *casseforti e lucchetti*. I mean, these people are a bit original. But he was really a genius. I think he was the guy who is considered to have invented nanotechnologies, because in the 80s he gave some remarks in one famous seminar talk that he gave at Caltech where he was working, talking about the opportunities of nanotechnologies, when technology starts to build devices that are small, nanoscale small. So I will stop now for 10 minutes and in a few slides I'll use the symbol "remember" to tell you "this you have to remember." And I'll just only give you this so that you are scared. So I will ask you informally to remember or to learn for the first time the plot, the graph of three functions, because, say four functions. One over r, which is what people call a hyperbolic function. Okay, it's one over r. This one is the famous exponential transient. Okay, so there is one minus... Okay. And this is the natural logarithm. And this is a linear term, it's a straight line. So you should be able, roughly, it's not that I'll ask you, "Here's millimeter paper," no, but roughly you should be able to plot these functions. Now that you're scared, we'll take a break for 10 minutes. I hope that you're not scared, but if you're scared, please come to me for mathematics. Thanks. Thank you. "ho caricato il giorno stesso però" (but I uploaded it the same day). I will be able to find the video that I have told you that I will find the description. What I've done is to make the description with Whisper and then put it into the... Thank you. Thank you. *pain* Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

I'm sure that inadvertently, the other time I started at 14:00 and today it was the same. In theory, I would end at 18:45, so I have to put an eye on it for a little less than 50 minutes. If not, it doesn't make sense. If not, I'll start first and finish at 18:00. But it won't happen. Ok, so I understand that you are tired and I hope that the... I hope to make it... I'm interrupting often, I'm just giving you videos and questions to make it a little bit more lively. Please speak if you are too bored or if you feel from now on that the style of the class is getting too hard. Not today, in general. So I know that you are tired, but these are very simple functions. And so I'm not asking you to do the so-called study of the function, say 1 over r. The limit as a function of r. And I'm not asking you to take the limit for r that goes to plus infinity, or r that goes to minus infinity, or to calculate the derivative or the second derivative. These are functions that just roughly by eye you should be able to do. So this is not a course in advanced calculus, it's not a course in mathematics. So it's a rough understanding of these functions. So any idea about who is somebody willing to help me plotting f(r) = 1 / r? You will have it on the slides, but if you want to challenge yourself, let me know what should I sketch. Okay, okay. So your colleague was making a sort of gentle curve, and indeed this is what I have in my head. Okay, maybe for negative r, but okay, negative maybe we will not care, because we are thinking of r as maybe a distance and the distance is only positive, but it is indeed the case. And again, you see, r is in the denominator, so when r gets very large, 1/r is getting squashed, it goes to 0. Yeah, okay, a mathematician would say it goes to 0+. Fine, okay, it will go to 0 from this part of the plane. And for r that goes to 0 from the right, it goes to plus infinity, because 1/r is something that grows over and over. So I'm not a mathematician myself, but roughly knowing that you have this profile is very convenient and useful.

The other one is only present for the charge or discharge of capacitors. So it's not because I'm in love with exponentials. They are nice, but I'm not... I'm in love with other things, not necessarily exponentials. So, and the way I would, it's f(r), what is it? It's f(r) = 1 - e^(-αr). The way that I still teach it to myself is looking at the exponent, assuming that alpha is a number, it's given, it's a positive number. You know that if you want to make me happy, the overall exponent of the exponential needs to be negative. Because if it's positive, you probably know that the exponential is exploding. And in biology, biophysics, I hope that nothing is exploding, particularly because I'm invoking the fact that the property that all physical systems should be dissipative. They should basically dissipate energy, so it's unlikely that things will go to plus infinity. Okay? So, if that f(r) is the value of the membrane potential across, so inside with respect to outside of a neuron, I don't expect it to explode, to go to plus infinity. It's starting to go to the other extreme where the exponential is... So, for r that goes to plus infinity, e to the minus... it goes to e to the minus infinity, so it goes to zero. So, you want to make me happy, check the exponentials, and this is also going to be relevant for differential equations. So, in that case, I know that the exponential, for r going in this direction... at some point, I will not have the exponential anymore. And as engineers do, a friend of mine made it very clear, saying engineering is not math, it is the science of approximation. So I would like to approximate things, and here I can see that it's the sum of two things. So even the graph, the plot, will be the superposition of two things. One that is always there, and the other one that at some point is not there anymore. So if at some point, yeah, ideally it's going to be at plus infinity, but in reality it's going to be on the order of 1/alpha, that is setting the scale of this equation. So here I only remain with 1. Because if r is so large, this can be neglected. If you want, you can do things properly, but yeah, I can see two pieces. And other things that I normally do, I test what happens when I put the argument of the exponent to zero. I do it because it's something that I always remember, what is the exponential of zero, that you all know is one. So if it's one, one minus one is zero. So, yeah, I should look for the concavity, but it's an exponential. So I know that it doesn't change. So the only thing that changes with r is this term here. And I know that it's something, it's an arch, that is either exploding or attenuating, going to dissipating, going to zero. So it's likely only going like this.

The logarithm, I think you know it or you don't. Logarithm of r. I'm on purpose using r instead of x, instead of t. So it may be that it annoys you a little bit, but it's purely just a variable name. So, fine, call it the way you want. It's purely a label. What is important is that I understand what is the independent variable, that is r. And you probably know that the logarithm, at least for real values, is not defined when the argument is negative. So the logarithm is the value that you have to give to the base, so it's an exponent that you have to apply to the base, that is e, in order to get the argument. It's the inverse operation of an exponential, and for an argument that is negative, it's not defined. You know, it's only one thing that you have to remember. And the graph of the logarithm is crossing this axis in one specific point. That is easy to remember. Do you know when, in other words, I'm actually searching for the value that makes... So where the logarithm is zero. So what is... One of my questions. So its value is one, am I right? So why it does not work... so I wanted to say what is the exponent that I have to give to the base e in order to have 0? It doesn't work, e to the 1 is 2.7 blah blah. Where is the problem? I have to think about it. But the plot is correct. I have to think about it. Again, it's not a course in math, and I will try to solve my own puzzle another time. And here for the straight line, you have one thing that is very important, is the angular coefficient, m. It tells you about the slope of the line, and then you have another value, p, that tells you where it crosses the axis. I don't remember it by heart. I simply say, "Okay, what happens if r is 0?" So r=0 means this axis here. So when r is 0, this term disappears. f needs to be p. So this is the value where the straight line is crossing the vertical axis. So these are crucial that you understand, that you remember that you are able to handle and to master roughly for the plots, for the graphs of these functions.

And another thing is the derivatives. So we're not talking about, well, we are also talking about integrals, but these are the derivatives that I would love you to refresh and remember. You know that the derivative of a constant, any constant, is zero, and 1/x is another one that, yeah, you could derive it from the incremental ratio, but do you remember what 1/x is? It's important because it comes in Coulomb's force, in the gravitational force you always have 1/r or 1/r^2, so this is somehow a polynomial with a negative exponent that is very important. No, I'm not asking for the integral, I'm asking for the derivative. So, in principle, you should write it as x to the power of -1 and then apply the rule. But it's, or vice versa, it's the ratio, say numerator and denominator, and you say it's the derivative of the numerator, which is 0, times the denominator, minus the derivative of the denominator multiplied by the numerator. So, it's 1, and because of that minus, and then you have here that you get x squared. So it's -1/x^2. You have time to refresh it. The derivative of the log is indeed 1/x, particularly if it's only if the log is a natural log. And then there is also this property that is very important, which is to say that the derivative is a linear operator. So if you have the derivative of a sum or of a subtraction, of a difference, what is the derivative? Yeah, and would it be the same? If here I would put some coefficients, 25 and -30, how would it change? Linear, ok, you know everything. So it's linear. And the other thing that we are going to use is the derivative of a composite function, for instance in this case the derivative of the log of c(x). It's a chain rule. I don't remember how it is called in Italian. *La regola delle funzioni composte*, but I don't remember if it's called the chain rule, it seems not. *C'erano i carabinieri un tempo, c'era la regola dei carabinieri, ma era un'altra cosa.* (There were the carabinieri once, there was the carabinieri rule, but that was something else.) Do you remember how this is... what you have to do here when you have a composite function? You take the derivative of the external one, and then you multiply it times the derivative of the argument. So in this case, it will be 1 over c(x) multiplied by the derivative of c. Let me know if it... Okay, I could have had them appearing slowly, slowly. Okay, and this is the only thing that we are going to use. Even written like this. The derivative of the log of C, that would be the concentration. And it's very important, because this also gives rise to some relationship with Einstein, which he is remembered for. It's about diffusion. It comes from that simple trick.

And I think the other thing is the concept of integrals. When you have the limits of integration, you invoke... So you know that integration is the inverse operation of the derivative, and the indefinite integral is basically... You could also call it an anti-derivative. And so, when you have the limits of integration, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, you actually have the primitive, and you calculate the primitive at one limit, minus the primitive calculated at the other limit. Does it ring any bell? And now, because this one is a log, and again, we are going to see exactly this integral later on, probably not today. Let me put it back, I'll keep speaking up until 7, and you may not like it. So here we are going to have exactly the log, and it's a difference of logs, and you know that because of the properties of logarithms, if you have a difference of logarithms with the same base, the result is the logarithm, yeah, yeah, it's the log of the ratio. So this is going to be omnipresent. So this you will get acquainted with. And another thing that we may... so this is not crucial because we are only using... I want to give you an intuition of the electric field in terms of the gravitational field and I want to use the Taylor expansion up to the first order. So a polynomial expansion up to the first order where I know that any function, any continuous and differentiable function, I can write it as the value around one point, so this is a number, this is like 27. So around 27, if h is very small I can approximate the function as the value of the function at that point plus basically a straight line, and this is the angular coefficient which is given by the derivative calculated at that point. It's the slope of the tangent to the function at that point. But this is not really crucial. We're not going to be... There is another way, another point in the next, probably next week, where we are looking at, maybe two weeks where we are using Taylor expansions, but maybe I'm not doing it. I'm only telling you that if you want, you can try.

And first of all, the differential equation, I tried to introduce this sign already last week. This is the only differential equation that I would love you to remember or to learn to solve. And again, you have this online refreshing video that, although it's my voice, it's a little bit monotonic and it's a bit boring, but I refresh different techniques, particularly when the equation is non-homogeneous. So when you do add some term here, and this term, say, for instance, is a constant. So if I read it aloud, this is a differential equation, meaning that the solution is not a number, so it's not an algebraic equation. The solution is a function, and it's a function such that when I take its derivative, I get the function itself. Okay, multiplied by some term, which is a constant, which is a number, a parameter. Okay, plus b, that's a little bit more involved. You need to be able to calculate the so-called particular integral. Or you do some heuristics. And the heuristic is that clearly the solution of the homogeneous equation associated with this ordinary differential equation is an exponential. Actually, it's a family of solutions. It's an infinite family of solutions. So this k is the one that you will fix by the initial condition. And here you claim that because here the right side, so this forcing term, depending if you're an engineer, you see this immediately as a linear system. So if this is the input to this equation, if this has the plus of being constant, then the solution must be of the same type, must be some constant. Now here I gave already the solution, but I should have called it big K. Something to identify, particularly by replacing this big K here and saying, "Okay, the derivative of a constant is zero minus A times big K plus B equals to zero." I can determine what K, big K, is. And we will not do anything more than this. You know that if B is instead a trigonometric function, then the solution is also of the kind of trigonometric functions. Actually, I think this is more general, and people were calling them *cisoidi*, *le funzioni cisoidali*. It means that you have trigonometric functions also pre-multiplied by an exponential, but we will not see that. And I remind you that if this b should be an arbitrary function, then the only way out is the convolution integral, which is maybe something that I... No, I did not, and I will probably only mention it once in the forthcoming classes. It's a filtering operator in the end, so this thing, this particular thing, as written like this, it's a low-pass filter. And, yeah, you need to remember that these exponentials are going everywhere, and that's why 1 - e^(-αr), or times x, or t... And you see that you will always see me being very worried when writing a differential equation, that here, the same state variable, F, appears here with a minus sign. If it's not a minus sign, then I get stressed because it's not a dissipative system and it can... it's exploding, and yada, yada. So I hope that with these stupid things, something will stick or will be refreshed in your brain.

Another thing that I will use is the orders of magnitude, particularly this giga, mega, kilo, so it's 1 billion, so 10 to the plus 9, sorry, 10 to the 9, 10 to the 6, 10 to the 3, and again, I will basically use milli, micro, nano, pico, and I remember, because milli is 3, I always go like this, I don't remember, so if you tell me pico, okay, maybe now I know that it's minus 12, but I do, so milli is 3, micro is 6, nano is 9 and pico is what follows nano. I cannot remember things by heart. There are of course exceptions because they are not in the MKS system, like the decimeter or centimeter. Fine, I remember that it's 10^-1 or 10^-2. This will become interesting because I will constantly push you to check your damn physical units. You have one way to check whether you are correct if you can check and test the measuring units. If you are summing at some point apples and pears, something is wrong. And if at some point in a differential equation like this, you have that B does not have the units of something, say that instead of being x it's time, it's a differential equation with time being the independent variable, B needs to be something per unit of time, because on the left-hand side you have something divided by time. And so the units here need to agree. So you will see me obsessing with these things, which is just an easy way to spot possible problems. Something that I remember that maybe is familiar for those of you who like beers and who've been to Germany, where you get in these beer gardens, where you have, particularly in summer, it's fantastic, they actually bring you a glass that is one liter of beer. And I cannot drink, although German beer is good, I was used to Belgian beers, and with Belgian beers you don't drink one liter. Only to say that you have something that you can keep in your hand that is one liter. Because this conversion... that is... if all... both liters and cubic decimeters are all volume indicators, they are all measuring units for volumes, it's only that liters are something that is more familiar to chemists, that basically had to deal with liquids, and they got used to this unit. Engineers and physicists, maybe they got used to something that was measured with a measuring tape, and they use meters and multiples and submultiples. But, yeah, they are the same. And I kept forgetting, but it's one cubic decimeter because it's something that you hold, 10 centimeters cubed, you can hold it in your hand, and it's beer in Germany. I don't know whether this will help or not.

#### **Section 4: The Resting Membrane Potential**

So why are we bothering with this concentration and density, mobility, electrical potential, and what was the other one, the flow, the flux? Because we have some investigative task for the couple of weeks that await us, that are the next two weeks. And it's, why if I take any cell, let me draw a cell, a neuron that gives me comfort. So I have one cell, and it's in any cell of your body, unless you are dead, and I will tell you why you could be dead, you have that conventionally, I'm referring, I'm taking the convention that is referring the electrical potential inside with respect to the outside. So outside is what I call conventionally, because potentials are defined with respect to a constant, an arbitrary constant, and I will refresh why there is this constant, why it is arbitrary, that I call it zero. So here it's zero millivolts. Inside your cell, all the cells of your body, there is an electrical potential that is non-zero, and it's negative. And for neurons, it's around minus 70 millivolts. There are different cell types in which you have minus 80 millivolts, minus 20 millivolts, and minus 70 millivolts is quite a lot compared to 3.3 volts of electronics or even smaller values of electrical potentials in microcircuits, microchips, is even a fraction. So it's a lot. Why is it minus 70 millivolts? I want to understand why it's negative and why it is minus 70. The reason why it's there is because you are not at thermodynamic equilibrium. Lucky for you and lucky for me, we are not yet dead. And being dead means that there is nothing, no more, at least maybe transiently there is, but when you are really dead, there is no difference between you and the environment. There is no energy spent to oppose entropy. You are as disordered as the environment. What there is in the environment is inside yourself. And if you are a cell, basically the membrane is rupturing, or at some point, things start to flow in and out, and you have identical things inside and outside. You are nature, you are completely embracing nature, you are dead. But if you are not dead, if you are eating bananas and chocolate, etc., you have disorder, sorry, you oppose disorder, you create order by spending energy, and you create some sort, apparently, of unequal ionic distribution inside and outside the cell. That's the whole story, but I would like to understand why. The reason is not that I'm obsessed, it is because if we understand why, we can make sense of why not, and why sometimes this electrical potential might change over time. If I know the mechanism, I can understand if things are changing over time, whether the mechanisms could change over time as well.

This is one example that I showed you. I don't know if I anticipated that I would have shown some neurons. So this is an experiment that we did many years ago. Just a cell from the cortex of a rat that we explanted the brain and we cut the brain in slices very quickly so that the tissue was not dying. It was actually still alive. And we put it under the stage of a microscope that we used. This is called a transmission microscope because light is going through, it's transmitted through the sample. And we are using infrared light because infrared light increases contrast. After all, cells, you know, are water, made of water, and they are surrounded by water, so there is no contrast. If you see them with a normal microscope, you see nothing because they are transparent, made of water, so there is no contrast. You can get contrast by some technique that is called differential interference contrast microscopy, which I'm not telling you about, that gives this beautiful picture like craters on the moon. But these are sort of three-dimensional renderings of the somas of cells. So you see that each cell has a body and each cell in this case has a pipette implanted into its stomach. So here, what we did was a little bit more ambitious than what was technically impossible to do in vivo. Instead of Hubel and Wiesel that had this tungsten electrode, very tiny, nearby an electrode, so like a microphone was here listening to the extracellular signal, here we did more. We got a pipette. This is the sort of top view of a conical glass pipette that has been sectioned by light, just because the microscope is creating some sort of light section. So that's why it looks like a triangle, and it's empty inside, and I will tell you why it's empty. And we push it almost inside the cell, because I wanted to see, to measure the electrical potential inside. I'm not happy with outside. Outside is boring. Okay, the only thing I get is a very tiny signal of a few, say, 100 microvolts, but this is just me speaking and somebody from outside of the class listening. I want to hear the whole story. I want to enter into the stomach of this cell. And if you do, you measure it on a voltmeter, you measure a negative minus 70 mV. And people call it with some strange nomenclature compared to engineers; they call this polarization. They say that the cells were polarized in the sense that they were not zero, so there was a polarization.

And sometimes this polarization goes away because these cells, particularly these pyramidal cells, in a time that is so fantastically small, and I'm fascinated by that because in a matter of a millisecond, or hundreds of microseconds, you have that this electrical potential can change very rapidly, incredibly rapidly for being a biological system. The world is able to commute and to open and close or to switch like a transistor so fast, and it's made of proteins, blobs, gel, ions, and the ions are moving slowly. It's not like electrons that are moving... okay, they are not moving fast, it's the electric field that moves fast in a wire. Let's say you don't have transistors that are operating at the gigahertz range. Here you have proteins. You have fatty acid molecules. What is changing so fast? And fast is fascinating to me because this is the time scale of thought. I'm thinking right now with action potentials changing rapidly over the time scales of around one millisecond. So the time of an action potential, this is called an action potential, as opposed to a resting potential, for obvious reasons. One is at rest, one is doing something, we don't know what, but it's doing something, is a fraction of a millisecond. Let's say half a millisecond. And it goes up to +30 millivolts. So minus 70 to plus 30 is 100 millivolts, it's 0.1 volts, which is remarkable. One... okay, now I had one banana but I also had a dish of pasta today. But still, it's not chat GPT and it's not my computer that is powered by an 80-volt power supply. It's with a few watts I'm able to sustain myself. So understanding why the hell you have -70 mV... if I can understand as a next step why the membrane potential can be changing in time, and it changes over time in cells that are called excitable. Neurons, some pancreatic cells, they are secreting hormones such as insulin, so the pancreatic beta cells. Muscles, of course, myocytes and cardiomyocytes. These are all cells in which the electrical potential changes, and apparently it's a trick that nature evolved to convert electrical signals into either information in the world of the brain, or motor actions, or mechanical contractions, so changes in reality, changes in elasticity. And because electricity is so fast and so easy to transmit, that was the way you could command and release, say having chemical release, so having chemical messaging and electrical messaging and mechanical messaging. So that's why there's this investigative work that I have to involve you with.

So it's essential, and if you are dead, you don't have this. This could be a question. You could probably say, "Okay, I could understand why this is -70 millivolts." Maybe your first guess would be that inside there are many more negatively charged particles than outside. It's a legitimate hypothesis. If you think carefully, you could also reach the opposite conclusion that you have a lot of positively charged ions outside and very few positively charged ions inside. And I would say you're close with both but it's more complicated than that. And the fact that in half a millisecond the membrane potential can change so rapidly leaves you with a question: how could it be? I mean these ions are fat, they have a mobility and this mobility is not so... they're not supersonic. They still have to swim, and if you are a swimmer or if you like swimming, you know that in solution you have friction, and this friction is quite remarkable. It's increasing the faster you go. So if you double the speed, the friction doubles. So it's Stokes' law. We will see it probably next week. So it's not clear how you could get something that is reacting electrically so fast with ions that are so sloppy. You can think, if you want, maybe you already know how this happens. But first I'll start with an omnipresent description that is unfortunately adding a little bit of a degree of complexity that I don't like. And this comes because you have physicists as well as chemists dealing with this electrolyte. An electrolyte is a solution in which you have charged particles. And, I mean, both were studying these systems. Chemists, they studied electrochemistry. And physicists studied electromagnetism. And they used, unfortunately, different conventions and different words. So, you have some solute, which is aqueous. Maybe it can be water, and we have a solvent, which is what is dissolved in this aqueous solution. And you can basically refer to the amount of this stuff, these balls, these particles, in two ways. They are equivalent. You could count per unit of volume. So you could literally take a small volume. Maybe you want to take it very small so that you can move this volume here and here and here. You count how many molecules are there. And you express this as a density, something that you know already. So the density is the number per unit of volume. So you take the number and you divide by the volume. And you divide by the volume because you don't want your choice to be affected by that specific volume that you chose. So you normalize by the volume. And chemists did the same, but they were actually not using counts, because they were already aware that in solution you don't have, like in the solar system that you have, how many planets are there? 10, 15, whatever. So a few numbers. In solution you have billions and billions of particles, so it's not practical to count them, and they are used to using a different measuring unit, which is very similar to when you say half a dozen, *mezza dozzina*, or three dozen. So, okay, what is special about the number 12? Okay, instead of saying 6 or 24 or 36, I just make it shorter and I say half a dozen or two dozens or three dozen. It's the same thing, or you could say centuries, four years. You could say one century instead of saying 100 years. It's purely a matter of laziness, maybe, or of convenience. So chemists were using moles. Have you ever heard about moles, molar concentration? And so these guys were counting in numbers, these guys were counting in dozens, and they were also using liters instead of volumes measured in, say, cubic centimeters or cubic decimeters. They were using liters because they were handling liquids. And moles per liter is called molarity. And it's indicated by a big M. Instead, the mole is sometimes indicated by "mol," written m-o-l. So it's not the animal. So this is a mole, but it's a different mole. And it's a purely conventional thing. It's the number of atoms in 12 grams of an isotope of carbon. So, okay, and how many were there? It's the Avogadro number. So it's 6.022 times 10 to the 23 molecules. This is a pure convention. So this could have been in another... no, another universe, in another timeline where it was not Avogadro or other chemists, whatever. So if it was the Middle East, like it was highly developed in terms of mathematics, and particularly mathematics, I'm thinking of Persian mathematicians, we could have ended up with something else. But, okay, conventionally we are stuck with this Avogadro number. This is the reference. So they are used to counting in 6 times 10 to the 23 multiples, because molecules are so many.

I'll conclude here and we'll close it. So if I want to go from one to the other, the only thing I have to be careful about is that I have to remember how a liter is converted into volume, and how one mole is converted into a number of molecules. So these two numbers. So if I have a solution that is concentrated one millimolar, it means that I have one millimole per liter. So 10 to the minus 3 moles divided by a liter. Literally I express it with, okay, 1 cubic decimeter that I can write it as 1,000 cubic centimeters. And then, okay, I'll divide this and I can express it as 6 times 10 to the 17 ions per cubic centimeter. So here, there is nothing to understand. The only thing is that going from one world to the other, you have a conversion factor. That's all. For next time, although you do have it on the slides, the solution, try to see whether it's a very trivial thing that I do as an exercise anyway. So, okay, this is, apart from the way you measure the volume, be careful, so it's the Avogadro number, but the volume has to be carefully converted. I'll ask you to tell me how many ions would be in a spherical cell filled with 150 millimolar of potassium. Just try. It's the only thing that you have to remember is maybe the volume of a sphere, which fine, you can look it up on Google, on a book, but it's not difficult per se. Maybe you don't remember it anymore because you didn't use it. And another thing that is interesting, you could, if you want, you can ask, what if all these ions were not uniformly distributed in the volume but they were instead distributed just around the membrane, which is actually the case, because the solution is a conductor. What would be the surface density? So can you go from a volumetric density to a surface density? And we can see, well we do have it on the slides, but otherwise we'll see it next week together. Thank you, and as usual, if you have questions, please come to me, otherwise I will not be able to help.


# Class 3 Transcript

Okay. Okay.

This is the third test of audio because the other time, despite the ambient microphone, the audio was not a great deal. I hope it *did* help you, but in this way, you should feel better here and I'm for sure able to provide this signal to the registration. Let's see how it is.

### Announcements

Three announcements. The first one is my personal curiosity. Has anyone read the material given during the first lesson on GitHub? The readings? The *Bignami* of Neurobiology, 2-3 pages. The book of Hubel, "Occhio, Cervello, Visione". Why do you think? Ok, ok.

*Potete iniziare a guardare quel materiale. Non è, diciamo, deletario, è fatto per potervi dare degli elementi utili. Se invece sapete già tutto di neurobiologia e di elettrofisiologia cellulare a un livello divulgativo, eccetera, ignorate il mio commento.*

The second comment, the second comment, the second comment is *legato* to my deficiencies. The other time I was *impantanato* to remember the definition of logarithm. The problem is that I don't remember the things I have to remember. The only thing I remember is that the logarithm is the inverse. *Se vi ricordate il mio*, I crashed because the mnemonic phrase didn't come to me: the logarithm is the quantity that I must put as the exponent of a certain base to get the argument of the logarithm. And here I am going to be because the logarithm of $1$ is $0$, and it is the only point in which this $\log(y)$ is remembered because it is the only point in which it is traversing the *asse*, intersecting the axes. And the other thing I have remembered is that for the argument that tends to $0$ from the left, the logarithm becomes negative, becomes negative, becomes negative.

So the only thing I should remember is that the inverse is the inverse of the exponential. So if I apply it to the natural logarithm, which means logarithm in base $e$, this means that here remains $x$. You can also think that this is a rule that makes it a logarithm and becomes a logarithm in base $e$, $e^1$, or, or, is the inverse. *E quindi qui c'è scritto che questa roba qua è l'esponente da dare alla base per avere l'argomento.* If the argument is $0$, what is the exponent that I have to give to $e$ in order to have $0$? I am going to write it again. It is the contrary. What is the exponent that I have to give to $e$ in order to have $1$? $y = 1$, $e^0$, $e^0 = 1$.

Anyway, third *annuncio*, interesting or less. During the first lesson, I told you that with that small amplification of electronics, I was able to measure an electromagnetic signal in a very banal, very *rosso* way, and I was not sure... I have a card of aluminum for food and I have all the circuit, of which I had no time to create something like that. So my operational amplifier with its various things, and its various electrical, was a different one. Two electrical and ground I applied to my body, and here there was the exit from the reference. I made a kind of *carte* and I've covered this circuit in the card. Do you know why I had this idea of getting into the card? If you've ever heard of it, I would like to make two words.

Ok, *e vi dice qualcosa se io dico "gabbia di Faraday"?*

### The Faraday Cage

It can be demonstrated, but we will not do it, maybe you have seen it in some course of electromagnetism, that in reality, dependent on the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation of an arbitrary electromagnetic field, at a certain frequency, it is possible to shield what is inside. And in some way, it has to do with Gauss's theorem; in some way, it has to do with the fact that in a conductor, the charges are arranged, at least in a static, quasi-static way, in a static, quasi-static regime, they are distributed on the surface, not inside. And therefore, it is used to shield electrophysiological recordings.

And if you come to the laboratory, I'll show you that we have, apart from anti-vibration tables that are optical tables—they are tables to avoid vibrations, but that is not a big problem—but above the table, we have mounted a Faraday cage above each table, which costs a *botto*. I am from Genoa and I am sensitive to these aspects because aluminum costs *l'ira di Dio*. In effect, in some cases, instead of an aluminum plate whose thickness is not the *stagnola*, which is even thinner, I believe the paper is about $0.2 \text{ mm}$ of *spessore*, in the case of aluminum, more than $1 \text{ mm}$ or $2 \text{ mm}$ of *spessore*, it is very *pesante*, it is extremely tight and therefore it is not particularly practical. So people use literally some of the *reti da pollaio*, that will be smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic field that you would want to cut off.

I will show you that the interference based on the cell phone is of the order of the cm, is of the order of the centimeter, so I have a fraction of a centimeter if the frequency is of hundreds of megahertz. For this to do it, I don't know, I remember the speed of light and I can, given the frequency, find the *lunghezza d'onda*. This is the same goal.

However, the key that I have not done at home is that this *scatola*, this and this is a point of... On the other side, there is a cable and I can attach it to the oscilloscope or to the *aggeggio* that was a digital-analog converter, digitized, that I would attach via USB to my computer. What I've done is I've *pinzato* this alligator, which is called alligator because it looks like a little alligator. I've *pinzato* the wire, because I wanted to contact the zero ground, but I've *pinzato* the *schermo*. I've *pinzato* a piece of paper. This has probably put all the same level of potential, the entire surface of the external surface was not *more*, in other words, *"appesa"*, as it says in terms of technicality, *"appeso"*, not "floating", and therefore I could have been able to be exactly the same potential as I made my measure.

It may be or may not be of interest.

If there are problems—now, none of you has contacted me, we haven't been doing anything particularly math, we're going to start a little more—I'm at your disposal. Don't expect necessarily the day before the exam, in which maybe I won't have much time to get into it. So if you can, if you want, if you need, you know where to find me.


Let me switch to English. And so, two questions for you.

### Review: Membrane Potential and Avogadro's Number

Do you maybe remember that last time—this is very key, it's a fundamental property—last time I said that all the cells, unless you're dead, unless you are at the thermodynamical equilibrium with your environment (so you're not any more distinct from it, you're completely whole with nature, and you're not Buddhist, so it's for really important things). Every cell has a difference of electrostatic potential inside with respect to the outside. Do you remember this?

And do you remember whether this difference of potential is negative or positive, assuming the convention that is inside with a reference that is outside the cell?

Okay, so you even remember the number. So I don't want... So this is really, really key. So it's negative. And for neurons, it's roughly around between $-60$, $-70$ [mV]. Other cells might have different numbers, but it's still always negative. I'm not aware of any cell that has this difference of potential that is positive.

It's very important because it's a way employed by living matter, by biology. Evolution found a way to make, through possible pores... I'm indicating the door because I'm thinking that I'm making in my mind the stupid analogy that this is the inside of a cell, and if I want to traffic molecules or stuff or food or whatever, coffee, whatever you eat and drink, maybe it's good to have not only doors, but force fields that are maybe working to move stuff from inside, from outside to inside, or vice versa.

Of course, you might have other mechanisms, devices like ionic pumps, and we will see at least qualitatively (maybe Professor Zoli might tell you about them), that are spending energy. And it's... I'm imagining outside a club there is one big muscle guy that is against maybe the electrochemical gradient and is actually taking in or pushing out stuff from inside the room. But that is consuming energy. Instead, if already *per se* you have some sort of electric field, say you have wind because we keep the windows open and just for free you get food in, this is easy, easier, and it doesn't cost energy.

The second thing that I would like to ask you is whether you remember the Avogadro number that we briefly mentioned. It's purely conventional, so there is nothing deep there. And I remind you this is the number of particles or molecules in one mole of matter. So this is in a way the convention. I call 'mole' a stuff that contains, say, an amount of sodium ions or about, say, whatever, water molecules, about chocolate beads, whatever, that have as many elements as the number of Avogadro. Do you at least remember the order of magnitude? $23$, okay, $10^{23}$. That's it. It's just this rough intuition that I would like to push you to develop. Not necessarily to remember things by heart; it will be gone. But at least a little bit, just a couple of things, it might be worth investigating.

### Review: Concentration vs. Density Problem

Did you have troubles attempting at this problem? I assume that the only thing that you had to do in order to answer the question, "if I give you the concentration, can you go back to the density or to the absolute number of ions?" is to remember the Avogadro number, to be careful, and to remember that chemists are friends. They simply had different units and they use litres instead of cubic centimetres, for instance, for defining their reference volumes. And so millimolar is referred to one litre.

And the other thing is maybe the volume of a sphere that you all remember being... Just to be always sure, if it's a volume, it's likely to be measured in cubic meters, cubic centimeters, whatever. Liters is also a measure of a volume. So there must be some $r^3$ or there must... in terms of units. So, okay, $4/3 \pi r^3$, it's been, for me, imprinted, I don't know, in one, I think it was the elementary school, and it was such a very bad experience that I got it imprinted. But you can check that makes sense that this is a volume, and so indeed, the radius of this small cell, spherical cell, is micrometre, so it will be cubic micrometre. In this context, it's stupid, because of course, this is the context so I can convert it to...

I did not convert. I simply made the multiplication $4 / 3 \times \pi$ ($3.14$ blah blah) and then the other thing is that I went to this answer remembering the conversion factor and this glass of beer that you get in Germany that is one liter and is one cubic decimeter, and you can convert it to cubic centimeters if you want.

So it's a huge, huge number of ions. So it makes sense that maybe you want to call this concentration $150$ instead of millimoles, so it seems to be relatively small. It's OK. It's actually quite large concentration for being inside the cell. Normally you don't get such a high concentration. And instead of talking about $18$, $19$ orders of magnitude, numerous molecules or particles.

If you didn't try, I mean you have all the steps. And even for the second question that is: assume that all these ions are distributed in the surface. So they don't stay in the room, in the bulk, but they stay close to the interface with the outside, because maybe the inside is conductive and maybe it's like when you go to the cinema and you don't want to stay... Yeah, this is a stupid comparison. You go to a cinema, you don't want to stay close to your friends because they are not friends, they are enemies, so you try to maximize the relative distance. So if you go to the cinema and you are an ion, a sodium ion, you are going to be repelled from all the others and you will repel the others. So they don't want to stay together. They will be trying to maximize the distance, the relative distance. So they will be accumulating at the surface, at the inner side of the membrane.

And it might be worth just roughly understanding what is the order of magnitude of ions when they are concentrated there. Try. It's stupid. It's very silly. But it may reactivate, unless you have it already engaged, it's a mental mechanism of simply writing and doing algebra and being careful not to make mistakes.

So after this first concept of purely conventional equivalence between concentration and density, we are going to work, you will see today, with these two concepts interchangeably. Mostly we will be talking about concentrations because it's easy to refer to an actual experiment.


### Electrostatic Forces: A Review

I would like to talk about, to refresh, because you certainly are an expert, about the electrostatic forces, particularly the **force of Coulomb**, a French scientist who first described it, and the associated things. So you have a **force**, you have a **field**, and you have a **potential**. It's not that every time that you have a force, then you have a potential. You probably vaguely remember that's what I'm referring to. And I would like just to refresh this, telling you again about the gravitational force and the gravitational force field and the gravitational potential, because the gravitational potential is something that you have, particularly if you go with a bike, you are very comfortable with.

#### Analogy: Gravity

So again, let me first talk about gravity. I don't know why I got this meme. It does random gravity checks. So this guy is Newton, and in terms of gravity compared to electrostatics, it's a little bit easy because you only have one type of mass. I'm not a physicist, so I'm ignoring antiprotons, antiparticles, so I have no idea whether the antiparticles are... they presumably are only antiparticles in terms of electric charge, not in terms of mass. I know about dark energy, but again, I'm ignorant in physics, so I'm only sticking to this classic description that Newton, one giant in the field, had to cope with and intuitively got it. That is, you have mass and the mass is attracting always.

How much? It depends on how the two masses in this case are far apart and how big they are, how concentrated, how dense they are. This is very silly, but I'm just using it just to remind you that forces require vectors. That means in one given point if you want to express quantitatively a force, you have to give me, say, in a Cartesian system, Cartesian axis system, you have to give me the three components. Because I have to identify an arrow. That means a direction and *verso e una direzione*. I don't know how *verso* is in English. So a direction and where the vector, the force, would be pointing to.

In this case, vectors are easy because the direction is the one that is going through both centers of each of those planets or those particles, those masses. And the *verso*, so the direction where these forces are pointing to, is also easy because it's only attractive. So this should be easy, and you probably know that this is a very famous expression for the force, which reconciled planetary motion and motions on Earth.

So, famous apples that are falling from the tree is governed by the same thing that makes planets going around the Sun or orbiting around each other, described by Kepler's laws, but it seems to be as a different thing. The Kepler's laws were okay, they were phenomenological. Also, this is phenomenological because we don't understand gravity, at least I don't think that we understand gravity in a very fundamental way. So this is describing in a unified way. And you know that the force, you remember, is proportional to how big are the masses, according to the product, and inversely depending on the square of the distance. And there is the famous gravitational constant that I don't remember, I don't indicate it.

So I indicate like this the intensity, the norm, the modulus, the amplitude, the intensity of the force, because the direction and the *verso*, the direction and the way they are pointing to, are just mentioned verbally. No, the direction is the line that is connecting the two centers of masses.

And sometimes, like particularly say when you have really, really big masses in astrophysics, maybe you don't want to deal with a property that depends on both. If you have two masses, you want to say, I want to have something that is a property of space. This is a very deep concept in physics, and it's when you switch from force to **field**. So, yes, you put a mass in one spot, and then the space starts to have, depending on where... there is a symmetry, of course, like this shading that is a little bit grayer in the center and lighter in the extreme. It's a property of the space. How much? If I place a test particle, a test mass here, then I will experience a force directed in the direction to connect in the minimal direction, in the minimal distance direction, connecting my test mass to the center of the bigger masses, but it could be even a small mass, it doesn't matter, and the direction is attractive. So the sign is attractive.

When you do that, you want to basically, assuming that the mass here is the big $M$ and say is the mass of our planet, you want to normalize, you want to have some description that is no longer measured in Newtons. This would be the measuring unit of this thing, which is going to be Newton. It's not going to be Newton anymore, it's going to be Newton per kilogram because I don't want to have something that depends on my test. I want to use any test, so I want to go to this description that I indicate with $E$. And you see there is no small $m$. But I can go if you give me the field, I can get the force and vice versa.

Does this sound completely unfamiliar to you? Probably not. Okay, so you're not too scared. Let me remind you. Okay, so Newton per kilogram.

So the other ingredient that I would like to mention, to refresh you, is that some force fields, they are **conservative**. That means that the work done to move one particle from one spot to another one depends only on the initial and the final position, not on the trajectory. You know it well if you are biking because you love to stay at some... Okay, I'm spoiling something that comes later. So those fields that are conserving mechanical energy are called conservative. And I'm just giving you as a fact. I'm not proving it. I don't even remember how to prove it, although I knew once many years ago.

You can go, you can get rid of the complexity of vector fields. The fact that in principle at every point in space you have three components. And so it might be a little bit complicated to handle and to manipulate and to make calculations on vector fields. So if there is one scalar field, one numerical quantity, that's fine. Okay, in every point might be different, but it gives me just one number, not three numbers, one number that is called **potential**. Then I can maybe use it more conveniently.

The point is, okay, how do I have, is it possible? For this conservative force field it's possible. There is a function, it's a function of the point. Okay, it might change also in time, but it doesn't matter. That is such that if I take its derivative, or more correctly, the **gradient**, so the derivative with respect to space, and of course in 3D it depends, okay, so which of the three directions you want to take the derivative? You want to assess how these things are changing in space. So you have to tell me where. And you maybe remember that in vector analysis, you have the gradient. You don't have the $\nabla$ operator. You have this thing here. And you don't have necessarily the derivative. Well, in a case of a spherical symmetry, yes, you have. And we will actually stick only to spherical symmetry.

And you also remember that this is basically, since some derivative differentiation operation is involved, I could define $V$, well, I cannot define, I can spot $V$, but also $V$ plus any constant, $25$ or $-52$, would work equally well. Provided that this constant is constant in space, when I take the gradient, or the derivative with respect to $r$, it's the same. So that's why we say that this potential is defined apart from a constant. You should all be familiar with these things.

And particularly, I remind you that we conventionally, I stress it in a moment a little bit more, we call zero gravitational potential the level of the sea, purely by convention. We claim that at the level of the sea, the gravitational potential is zero. But yeah, okay, you could have made any other choices. So in other words, you add or subtract something so that the position $r$ where that's potentially zero, sorry, where, no... So at that position, say at the level of the *sea*, these $V$ and the constant are, say, cancelling and you get what you want, that is conventionally you call it zero. So through tweaking of that constant, you can say that at this point the potential is zero and it's an arbitrary choice, there is nothing magic. And mathematically is written there. You go from a scalar field to a vector field because basically you have a gradient.

The other catch is that for this definition we consider **minus**. So the potential is the function such that when you take **minus** the gradient you get the field, the gravitational field. And so for instance, without particularly being a genius, if you consider this mathematical expression and you remember one of the few derivatives that I asked you to remember, $1 / x$, okay since here the independent variable is $r$, if you take the derivative of $1 / r$, you probably know that is $-1 / r^2$. Of course you can derive it properly that you have to take the numerator, you multiply by the derivative of the denominator, etc. But say it's one of the few derivatives that you could learn, you could remember by heart. And indeed if you define $-Gm / r$, when you take the gradient, you take the derivative with respect to $r$, and you change the sign, you go back to the expression of the field that is $Gm / r^2$. So $r^2$ is always there in the field and in the force. In the potential it goes like $1 / r$, which may or might not be deep as a concept but it's a consequence of this.

I don't know whether it's now or later I have a very silly meme where you will see that one person is maybe overwhelmed by working with vectors but with scalars it's a different story, it's easier. I have also a demo to show you. And okay here you get back what I just said.

So something that we can do, we can just to motivate something that you might learn or remember mnemonically, that masses (like your bike) move in the gravitational field of the planet from points with **higher** gravitational potential to points with **lower** gravitational potential, from higher altitude to lower altitude. It's the same thing because the force field is attracting and is attracting everything to the center of the planet and that's why the potential is... as more when you... is negative and when you increase the distance the potential is getting smaller in absolute terms. And in fact, if you think, okay, so there is here the big mass, here is the distance. If I plot the function $V(r)$, it's minus. So the minus is making it flip that hyperbola from the first quadrant to the fourth quadrant. And so intuitively you would say if I have a test mass and I put it here, well it will be attracted. So technically it's moving along this potential profile, indeed going from points where in absolute terms you have higher potential to points that are lower potential.

I'm making this as a premise, although maybe it's irrelevant and trivial for you, because in the electrostatic case it gets a little bit trickier, and I wanted to refresh it. There it's trickier because you can have different kind of properties of the particles. They can be charged positively or negatively.

Something that I'm not telling you is that if you consider that expression and you take the Taylor first order... I don't know whether you have been taught like this ever, I was not, but if you take the Taylor expansion to the first order and you simply are considering that you move around some certain distance from the center of the mass, here I'm precisely thinking of our planet, and you are around this value, so you're approximating locally this function just with a straight line, around this $R_0$, and you call $h$ the quantity that you want to investigate. It's $R_0 + h$. $h$ is your new variable. You basically recover, because of the sign, this is just a number, and it's where the story of the level of the sea... you recover the intuition that the more $h$, the more the height, the larger is the gravitational potential. Play. Just try to do it by yourself, and it may connect few synapses in your brain.


### The Coulomb Electrostatic Force

But I would like to talk about the **Coulomb electrostatic force** and I wonder whether, if you consider these two fundamental forces, you ever thought which is stronger? Well, you have it in the slides, but if you knew already which one is stronger. Is Coulomb better than Newton, stronger than Newton? Okay, so the counter-example would be that I have to find a mass so large but weakly... with very, very small charge. Okay, let me consider not an arbitrary case, but just the case of chemical or even biological molecules.

The fact that Coulomb is extraordinarily larger, I think it's $38$, $40$ orders of magnitude, I don't remember by heart, is the reason why life could develop. It's because chemical macromolecules or even chemical molecules could stay together. Because if it was only due to gravitation, it would be so weak that basically it's as if it's not there. And molecules or ions or macromolecules would simply fly away. A DNA molecule would never be able to exist in a universe where you don't have such a huge predominance of the Coulomb electrostatic interactions.

And do you know why there is attenuation for both, for the gravitation as well as the electrostatic forces, $1$ over the square *root*, sorry, the **square of the distance**? You could try to search on the internet for this explanation. It's something related to the geometry of space. I'm not daring saying space-time, it's space. And particularly it's clear when you think of electromagnetic radiation in the visible. So light is electromagnetism, and light, the attenuation goes like $1 / r^2$. Because if you imagine that you have a star in the center and it's emitting some certain density of light, after a given distance, this sphere of light is becoming considerably larger and larger and larger. For some conservation of energy, you would expect that everything is conserved, it's not being removed or deleted. But your eye is very tiny, so it's not integrating the entire volumetric, actually it's called *angolo solido*, it's not integrating in 3D, it's just picking up a little bit, a fraction of this. And the further apart you are, the more what you capture is $1 / r^2$. It's very interesting and there are many even light talks or light papers and things on this $1 / r^2$.

So it's **$39$ orders of magnitude stronger**. That's the French Coulomb, instead Newton was British. Near the St. Pancras Station in London, if you go there, there is a statue of Newton. And again, this is, if you consider elementary particles, they are charged. And addressing the correct criticism by your colleague, I could say that the mass is probably not as represented as charge. Charge is... so you could have a very tiny particle in terms of very light, but extremely charged in comparative terms. But it was a good objection.

So for electrostatic fields, you have two... so I'm considering the static or quasi-static case. So I'm considering a regime in which you don't have the generation of a magnetic field that is concatenated to the electric field because this is changing over time. If it changes over time, there will always be, but the intensity and the wavelength can be neglected. So I'm considering the case where things are not moving. And I remind you that you have two classes, two families. You have one property that the particles, if they are charged, they are say blue and they are red. So they can be of one class or they can be of the other class. Charged positively or charged negatively. It's purely conventional that we call something positive and something negative.

What is important to remember is that if you have the same quality, then the force is **repulsive**. See the sodium ions going to the cinema but not liking each other and so being repelled and causing repulsion from each other. If they are of different species... the opposites attract, even there was a song by Paula Abdul many years ago in the 80s. And so if they are of a different quality, they **attract**.

And it's the same thing. It goes depending on with some sort of constant, and here it has been unpacked because it's relevant in a moment to talk about it. But it depends on the product of these two qualities or quantities that are called the charge. So it's an elementary property. I'm not entering into the details what is the charge. And apologies here, I should have not called it $r_0$. $r_0$ is the specific distance in these two examples over the independent variable or the name of this axis that is called generically $r$. So it goes like $1 / r^2$ like for gravitation and it depends on the product. But here the product can be negative, so the sign of the force can be indeed... can be repulsive, not only attractive.

And again, same story, if I have say a positively charged particle and I put it here, assuming that my test particle is always positive just purely by convention, I would like to have something to tell me that if I place something... to express that if I *press*... if I push or place the test particle in different... test charge in different spots around this, I am basically measuring a property of the space, not of the two specific charges. And again I go from the Coulomb force to the **force field**. And you see that there is only one $Q$, the $Q$ the charge of this one, not the other one. And again it's not Newton, it's Newton per... before it was Newton per kilogram, here it's Newton per Coulomb. And by reworking the unit you can also express this as Volt per meter.

I have to think, I don't remember why... oh sorry... yeah sorry, I'm... yeah, my brain was interpreting $V$ as voltage. I'm tired, I did not sleep, and this *Olt* I thought it was $dt$ and I thought, no why? Why should be $dt$? The time should not be there. No, it's **Volt per meter**. I remember this because if you go on the news and you look for safety limits of electromagnetic or electrostatic force fields near the antennas of Radio Maria in Rome, you actually have a number that is expressed in Volt/meter. If it's too large, Volt/meter, then it's dangerous for cells. Obviously it's fascinating to understand, okay, but why it's dangerous? What exactly is the interaction with the biological hardware?

#### Permittivity

What else? Something important that is different from the electrostatic case, sorry, from the gravitational case is that you have this quantity here apart from the $4\pi$ that again has geometrical reasons, but... and about spheres, but I'm not talking about that. You have one value of a constant that is called **permittivity of the vacuum** ($\epsilon_0$) and another one that is adimensional and is called the **relative permittivity of the medium** ($\epsilon_r$). And here there is another lesson. So this one $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity. Permittivity means that it gives permission. So the larger it is (because it's at the denominator) the smaller is the force.

And this is key for having chemical reactions and life being developed in **water**, in aqueous media, instead of in the vacuum. Because the other value, so this is $\epsilon_0$ is expressed in Farad per meter, but the other relative permittivity is without dimension. One is the permittivity of the vacuum. If you look at what is the permittivity of water, it's almost two orders of magnitude larger. And being at a denominator it means that you have a sodium chloride molecule and you put it in water, then you... because the force that was much more intense in the vacuum, you put it in water, or even in dry air is not too far, okay it's around $1$. But as soon as you put it in water, the two ions constituting the two molecules... constituting particles constituting the molecules, sodium and chloride, may fly apart, fly away, just because you have $1 / 100$. So it's $100$ times less intense this electrostatic force.

And what it's interesting is that for phospholipids, now I'm throwing it like this without any justification, you have a value that is in between. Cells are made, particularly the cell membrane is made of lipids, and I'm particularly fascinated, we will briefly discuss it later, that the first time people started thinking of that cells, it was in the 19th century, that cells might have a membrane. And the membrane is a crucial point because it makes inside different than the outside. It makes a distinction between the environment and what is not the environment, what is *me* and what is *not me*, is not necessarily so obvious concept. And people could not observe with microscopes, because it's so thin, so small, could not make inference or guess about the thickness. And they did it purely by... the first time they did it by electrical methods, precisely because it was possible to *know* the relative permittivity of individual components of the lipids.

And to me it's fascinating that you don't see something, compare it to a capacitor, and we will see later why the membrane is acting as a capacitor, you can guess the distance between the two plates of the capacitor, so the thickness of the membrane, by an electrical measure. It's not the first time. There is another... for understanding how these pores, these doors that make the inside of the cell connected to the outside of the cells... the first time people could not see them and they could only measure it electrically. So it's a primate of electricity and electrical methods compared to optical methods, to optics and microscopy.

#### Quantization of Charge

The other things that I would like to remind you, because we will use it often, is that the electron, so the charge in general is **quantized**. You cannot have an arbitrary value of charge, it comes in multiples of an elementary value that is $1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ Coulomb}$. And for instance in the case of this sodium chloride that is dissociating in water, you probably know better than I do this is reversible. And indeed when I write $\text{Na}^+$ and $\text{Cl}^-$, what I mean is that this guy has a positive charge and because there is only one plus and I'm thinking of the valency etc., I'm specifically referring to this value. And when there is a minus, so this one is negatively charged with the opposite sign so that both are somehow canceling so that the molecule is electroneutral. This you should be roughly familiar with all these things.

So this is the story of vector fields. In every point even in 2D it might be quite daunting. So this guy is depressed. Maybe you don't know who this guy is but is famous in my generation, well even in the previous generation. If you have scalar quantities it is much better.


#### Electrostatic Potential and Superposition

So even in this case, the electrostatic force fields are conserving mechanical energy and therefore you have one function of the point such that if I take minus and I take the gradient, I can describe the electrostatic field. So in other words, given the electrostatic field, it always exists a potential function. And this potential function is again, is defined apart from a constant. Instead, if here it was, instead of $V$ it was $V + 25 \text{ millivolt}$, okay, when you take the gradients the constant will go away because the derivative of a constant is zero. So you get the same electric field regardless of these reference. And the reference of these aluminum foil that I wrapped my circuit around... so it's not anymore the level of the sea where I say, so the height is zero and so the potential I call it zero. Here is just an arbitrary point where I call the potential zero. And normally is, it is considered in what is called the electrophysiological convention, not a very original name, zero for me is outside the cell where I have some sort of reference electrode. But we will be more on this.

So the space or the expression of this potential... before for the gravitational was easier because it was $G$ and here it's just a number, there is nothing to understand. This is one number that it's known... goes like the charge divided by the distance. So it's $1 / r$ for the exact same reason.

Let me probably stop... let me see what is next. Yeah, okay, this is... this is important. One minute and I'm done.

So something that is very cool, but I'm not... I have no time to really to go more in details, is that Maxwell equations are linear in the sense that the **superposition of the effects** holds. If you want to understand what is the electrostatic potential, so it's a property of the space, in this point, $P$, I choose that point... When you have this collection of small, large, positive, negative charges, it's enough that you consider the superposition of the situation that you would have if you had only one charge at a time.

If you had only this big one that is red, you would have... you have to calculate the distance, and you will have, okay, this pre-multiplication factor is just a number of stone, you will have only $Q_1$ divided by the distance between this $Q_1$ charge to the point $P$. Now you make disappearing the red large charge, you make the appearing only the blue small that is considerably further apart and you would have in that case, you would have $Q_2$ divided by the distance.

So if you want to understand or express what happens if you have in one point, say inside the cell, you have $-70 \text{ millivolt}$ with respect to the outside where it's zero... you may say, okay, well if you... if I know where the charges are located, I can basically consider a sort of superposition of the effects, which is some sort of weighted sum of the charges. Clearly, okay, one big charge, if it's a big positive charge, is going to contribute positively to the potential over there. But if it's very far apart, $1 / r$ will attenuate that contribution.

So with this you could maybe start thinking, okay, maybe if I see $-70 \text{ millivolt}$, if this holds true, maybe it means that I have many negatively charged particles inside the cell. And that would be perfectly legitimate, but it's not entirely correct.

If you have questions now in the break... let's stop and wait for $10$ minutes.

Let me restart. You... I will point you to it in a moment, where with a so-called web app, that means it's an application that is only requiring a web browser, you can go and say, let me not take it, say, I can take a lot of negative charge, in this case it's $1$ minus... $-1 \text{ nanocoulomb}$, $-1 \text{ nanocoulomb}$, it's a very small charge. And I can also have a sensor, so this is the test particle, and you see that these are the lines of the force field and it's relatively complicated. I'm having fun, you see? Saturday night, what do you do? I'm having fun playing with charges. And yeah, you can play with it, but see what happens if you are only looking at a scalar quantity. So there is no more arrows. And what remains is some sort of shading that reminds maybe the concentration of, say, smoke. If I should smoke here, there will be a very high density of smoke, of particle here. There will be maybe diffusing, there will be less intense concentration of smoke, less intense value of the electrostatic potential in one spot far that it goes like $1 / r$ and it goes far.

And if I have different distribution of charges... so it's not... This sensor is a voltmeter. So in this... so you see at some distance from this distribution of charge, the electrostatic potential that I... that I'm detecting here in the points identified by the cross, I see minus four... so it seems to be negative. If I get maybe close to the... to the positive charge, they get positive, but otherwise is... is negative. So maybe doesn't get... doesn't get $-70$, but this might say... You could play. After a few minutes you... you will be fed up. This could give you some sort of intuitive understanding of why, first of all, is easier to work with potentials and what does it mean this superposition of the effect, when I remind you the task is to understand why there is this damn $-70 \text{ millivolt}$.

#### Potential, Charge Movement, and Current

Something else that I wanted to... in addition that I wanted to talk about is the exact same story saying that if you have positive charge, so you have one big charge that is positive, a **positive charge** would move from point with **higher potential** to point with **lower potential**. I think I have here... if I have a battery... I hope that you, maybe I said it, I didn't, well it's difficult but I hope that you, well don't do it because it's dangerous, but I hope that maybe in your childhood you had... you licked batteries, particularly the $9 \text{ Volt}$ batteries. But anyway, so one pole of this battery is $1.5 \text{ Volts}$ with respect to the other, it's the negative, but you could... you could say that the difference of potential from here to here is $1.5$. So it means that in this point you have $1.5 \text{ Volts}$. And so if you have a positive charge, because of the potential generated by this big blue charge, it would move along... will be repelled and it will be move along these potential profile, indeed moving from points of high voltage to points of low voltage.

I tell you this because for many years there was the misunderstanding of... centuries? No, years... there was the understanding and still it's the same convention, that electrical currents are... in conductors, in metallic conductors are... is carried by positive charge. And indeed you know that if you have here... you have a circuit, the current goes from the plus to the minus. Well, electrons are negatively charged. And so actually it's the **negative charges** are moving from points with **lower** electrostatic potential to points with **higher** electrostatic potential.

I wanted once in your life to revisit this important concept, to know that it's wrong, it's a different convention, but it kind of fits whatever you do with the story of repulsion or attraction. So if you are in the world of Coulomb, of force field, you only have to remember the sign of the two particles, but if you're in the world of potentials, it's easier. And you only have to remember, like in the gravitational field, you are by bike and the bike naturally goes from points of high potential to points of low potential. And for electrostatic is the same, unless you are a negative charge, which is the exact opposite. And this is indeed what the real electrical currents are carried along.

So here I'm just, it's already since last week that I'm stimulating and saying, okay, $-70 \text{ millivolt}$, what do you think? I told you that now we know or we know again the superposition of the effects and so if you have $-70$, well, it could be that you have a lot of negative charge. Would not be shameful to reason like this, but it can also mean the exact opposite, as we will see in a moment. And again, I hope that you started thinking. I would love if you could keep these *critics* in your brain alive.

### Biophysical Primitives: Mobility and Friction

But first I need other elements, other primitives in biophysics, and one is called **mobility**. It's purely a description, is a conventional description as you will see, of how tough is for one particle to swim in solution, to move in in an aqueous medium, if it is a sodium or *chlorine* ion and if maybe one ion molecularly is fat and another ion is thin, slim.

And I start with the... with the parachute. Do you know why these guys are not dying? Probably you would say, well, it's because of the parachute. Do you know what the parachute is doing? So you probably know that in proximity to the... of the... of the surface of our planet you have an acceleration of $9.8 \text{ square meters per second}$ or meters per second square. So every second you accelerate, you change your velocity by roughly $10 \text{ meters per second}$. So why is not dying *to see*, crushing himself or herself in the ground?

Which is by the way, is the same reason why when it rains, the drops of rain are not damaging your scalp, killing you on an instant. They should. The reason why they don't is because they have, well there is not really the parachute, but because they are... the drops of water, of rain and the parachuters are moving in a dense medium that is air. And air is causing **friction**, viscous friction.

So you have in the general case... you don't have raindrops and you don't have parachuters... but you have a particle that is moving in an *aqua* solution under some external force. I don't care whether it's gravity, whether it's electrostatic potential, sorry, electrostatic forces, I don't care. And I only have to invoke or remember one guy, **Stokes**, who studied friction. And actually it is very interesting because he studied how the geometry of a particle in a solution is affecting this friction. But for the sake of simplicity here we don't care, we just basically say that the friction that is familiar to those of you who are maybe swimming in the sea is increasing, is proportional to the velocity, is not constant. The faster you go the more the deceleration you experience. And it goes in the opposite direction of course from your motion because it is again, it's a friction, it *tries* to oppose.

So let me invoke Newton's second law of the dynamics, $F = m \times a$. Force equals mass times acceleration. Of course acceleration I express this as a first time derivative of the velocity. And... And again you will see why I'm obsessed by that always boring usual differential equation because it's always the same linear first order constant coefficient equation that comes over and over, at least in this course, not in nature but at least in this course.

So here I can write the overall sum of all forces. I'm thinking of a monodimensional case otherwise I will be making a necessary complexity. So I'm considering that there is some sort of direction of motion that I call $x$. $x$ is a coordinate, so I can have some velocity. I can even define an acceleration if you want. And I can define a position. And I can go from one to the other by differentiating, by derivatives. And along this monodimensional coordinate, which is describing the system in all its complexity, I have two forces that are the sum, so $F$ equals mass times acceleration, $M$... is the total force, and the friction is opposing. So if I take this axis along the direction of the motion, say along the direction where I call positive the force that is positive in this direction, then the friction force needs to have a minus. And this $\lambda$ is a constant, is a positive constant and is the... basically is the... is a factor that is describing how big is the viscous friction. And you see here this is given, it's proportional to the velocity. The faster you go... the slower you are... so... so the slower is the... the faster you go the stronger is *these* friction force.

I remind you that these are forces and *these* are the world of velocities, positions, and acceleration. So they are slightly different beasts and the difference is because here you have a derivative. Again, it's the always usual boring differential equation and if I write it down, so you actually see here, friction I replace $-\lambda v$.

I told you the other time that if you want to make me happy you have to ensure that if you present me with a differential equation that the state variable in the left hand side, in this case, has a minus sign. Because in my brain I have always the automatic reaction saying, okay, yeah, the solution, at least the solution of the homogeneous equation associated, is an exponential. I have to put the exponential to something and if this something has a negative sign, I'm happy because the system is dissipative and this friction is dissipating energy. It's actually dissipating energy in an irreversible way as heat. So things should not explode. I should not expect the velocity to exponentially increase, *vice versa*. They should be exponentially *decay*. So make me happy and always keep an eye on what you have from the other hand side of this equation because this is what you're going to put in the exponent. True, there is this constant here $m$, but $m$ is positive so okay, I could divide both sides of this equation by $m$ and here will be $-\lambda / m$. Okay, still it will remain positive. So the minus, I'm grateful for this minus which is the Stokes law.

And of course this is not an homogeneous equation, so in principle I'm hand-waving, but you allow me to assume that this non-homogeneous term is constant in time. It's given and it's a constant. It's not an arbitrary function of time. And it could be as constant as gravitation or as constant as the Coulomb force that a big charge is exerting on one charged particle that is entering in solution and moving along this direction. It doesn't change in time. I don't care whether it changes in space. Here it's a differential equation with time. If that's the case, I can apply those heuristics. And so if the force in terms is constant, then likely the input term is also constant. And I can identify which constant it is by direct substitution.

Anyway, to make a long story short, I don't even care about the initial condition that would allow me to select one among the infinite solutions of this differential equation. Because you see here, it's when I'm very happy. So this term is going to vanish. And the reason why this is vanishing is because friction has the property of making particles approaching the so-called **limit velocity**. So, parachuters, because of friction of the air and the same for water raindrops, are not constantly accelerating over... At some point they stabilize. I spoke to people throwing themselves from an airplane, just skydiving, I think it's called, even without, before opening the parachute. The first few seconds are ugly, because you feel it in your stomach, the acceleration when you're falling, but at some point, then you don't accelerate anymore. And in principle, it's indistinguishable from a reference frame that is not moving.

And this second is given by this constant, which is the inverse of the time constant of this equation. It tells when the transient is gone, is over. So this friend of mine doing skydiving, after a while, his velocity became constant. Okay, it might be unpleasant, because particularly your visual scene, the visual field is expanding, so you're clearly, if you don't open the parachute, you're dying. You're not constantly accelerating and your stomach is not telling you that. And... and the reason why this can be done, we can neglect it, is because the mass and the... so this ratio between $\lambda$ and $m$ is very, very, very large because the mass is very, very small. And if I have this that is very, very large it means that one divided by this quantity, that is the time constant, is very small. So in a matter of picoseconds or faster, an ion in solution will reach this limit velocity.

And therefore I can write this relationship which is the limit velocity, so the **velocity is basically proportional to the force field**. Newton would be upset and would say, "beware, I think this is... it goes to the time before Newton." People... forces were directly translating into movement, and Newton said, "No, force is equivalent to an acceleration, not to a velocity." Unless you're in a viscous medium. If you are in a viscous medium, then if you double the force instantaneously, well, it's not really instantaneously because you have still some latency, but say, very rapidly, you're changing the velocity. This is crucial because we are swimmers. We stay in solution.

And people, instead of calling $\lambda$ the Stokes coefficient, Stokes parameter, Stokes coefficient, they call $u$ **mobility**, $1 / \lambda$. So this is my definition of mobility and it tells that the velocity is proportional to the force field. And you will see in a moment why this is relevant.

I warn you that in the literature, there is, in books, you have also the tables with the numbers, with numerical numbers of people that calculated the mobility, and how they could calculate it, well, they simply... they had to calculate the velocity. They knew the force, they calculated the velocity, and they basically had the mobility. But they had... they worked with the charged particles. And in our case, this is what is called **absolute mobility**. So it's a relationship between the force and the Stokes parameter. And it's measured in meters per second Newton.

If you have the charged particles, in the book you call it... and they are basically referred to not absolute, but **electrical mobility**. And instead of being a force, it's a force field. And so somewhere compared to the force you divide it by a charge. So here in between there is the charge, or if you want really to *spaccare il capello*, if you want to be very picky, you have to put the total charge, so that is the elementary charge multiplied by the valency of that particularly ionic species. And the valency is here in the absolute term is the... the modulus, because I don't care whether it's positive or negative in the settings that I'm used. It's enough that it's making the particle moving. Only just to tell you that if it's there it is measured as meters per Coulomb per second... meter per *cool* divided by seconds per Newton. So just be aware that in books you may find other numbers. It's the same thing apart from this conversion factor.

But anyway, we always stay here and anyway we don't look at numerical numbers. So you can go from one to the other apart from the elementary charge or, yeah, the total charge if you... if you're talking about say calcium ions that in solution they dissociate and they have $Z = 2$. So the valency of a calcium ions is $2$, they have $2$ positive charge, elementary charge.

These are some number and you see that the potassium and sodium and chlorine they are more or less of the same order of magnitude. Some ion has an easier time to swim than others. And you might see some other numbers but they are different units so that's why you don't see exactly the same. It's $10^{-8}$ and here it's $10^{11}$ so you would say it's crazy. No, it's because here somewhere you have $1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ Coulomb}$ at the denominator. But okay, that's it.

This is however wrong, but we don't care, we stick with this approximation because as you know ions in solutions are not swimming like this naked. They don't like to be naked. They are immediately neutralized by water dipoles that are constituting what is called the **hydration sheet**, hydration layer. So sometimes you might have ions that are very slim but they have a very big hydration sheet around them. And otherwise ions that are fat but they have maybe... they are not necessarily more fat than one slim ions with the hydration sheet.

### Flux of Particles

The last conventional things that I need for the following is the **flux of particles**. So I'm thinking of some sort of external fields or forces. I don't know what forces they might be. I anticipate it's not gravity because gravity is, with all due respect to Newton, is very weak and it's not really playing any role. I'm considering mobility, so I'm considering how friction basically, how good is one molecule, particle. Look, particles could even be not electrically charged, and we will see together. So it's not that if you're in solution you need to be electrically charged. There are other phenomena that happens if you're not electrically charged. And then the other thing is some sort of way to describe, to measure, to understand quantitatively how under a certain force, with a given mobility, I give rise to a flow, to a flux of matter.

But I need to be precise because there might be several ways to define flux of particles. How would you define it? What I'm thinking is, I'm thinking of a river. And the river is flowing, and it can be a small river or a large river, and the velocity of the particles can be really large, even if it's small or if it's big. So there are two kind of things in this view. I wonder whether you could suggest me what they are. One needs to be if they are small or large, so some sort of section or cross-section of these flux, so space, surface. And of course there is another quantity which tells me how fast things go. So time is also an important thing.

Any idea? What would you call it? Flux. You would say it's an amount of water... well maybe for electrical currents you know that currents are measured in Amperes. And Coulomb per second. So this, apart from the formal definition, is because people thought, well it's a flux but it's in a wire, maybe in a conductor... well I don't care. It's not a density, it's just an absolute flow and is basically in a given amount of time I move a certain amount of charge, one Coulomb. If I move one Coulomb at every second and I really imagine one big charge, blue charge, that is one Coulomb and is moving, moving to the left in one second, so it's not particularly fast, then I will have one Ampere, which is quite a big current.

Here, I told you I'm interested in if the section or the cross section is large or small. So I'm interested in **densities**. So again, let me see if my method would match yours. So I call it $J$. $J$ might resonate with a current density, but in this case, the particles may or may not be charged. So the units are not necessarily, we will see what the units are with this definition, are not Amperes, because there is no Coulomb, at least not necessarily.

And here is the first time that I can work with both, with either densities or concentrations. And I know how to go from one to the other, so they're not scaring me anymore. And this flux, just for simplicity, I'm considering one-dimensional movement. There is some velocity and there is some external force. But one way is this one. And here you see why physicists would be happy with densities and the chemist would say, "No, let's use mole."

So it's a **number of...** Pick your field, pick your part of the game field. So if you want to be a physicist, say number of particles moving through the surface, the cross-section of the surface. Maybe I would like to make that the surface of passage is not really having an impact. I would like to normalize. So if it's a big $10 \text{ square meters}$, or if it's a very small blood capillary, I don't care. I would like the flux to be a density measure, a specific measure, not an absolute measure. So it's a number of particles moving through a surface, a unitary surface, say one square meter or one square micrometer, in the unit's time interval, exactly like for the current.

And if you like more chemists and you like the moles, it's basically the number of moles moving again, the same thing through the unitary surface in a unitary time interval.

Let me try to graphically unwrap it and you tell me whether I'm... well, it's a crappy sketch. Here again my direction of movement, now I put it horizontally because it's... I don't know, I go in the lexicographic order from left to right. And although here I was thinking of something falling in a jar made of liquid... but... so with the jar with a bottle made of liquid is because maybe gravity would make this particle slowing down and reaching a limit velocity. Here I don't care. So I'm assuming that the force is along this direction and it's pushing the particles from left to right. And here I conventionally identify a reference surface that I call $\Delta S$, delta because I'm perverse, at some point maybe it will go to zero or I will simply normalize it, I will divide by it. And I have a watch and I wait one $\Delta t$. Nothing is infinitesimal so far. They are not infinitesimal measures yet.

But I basically say if things are moving, it means that they do, in a unit of time, they move of some length, some meters per second. So in one second or in alpha second, things will be moved. If I take two pictures, one now and one after one $\Delta t$, I can probably identify a displacement of all these particles that were, at the time of the first picture, they were all stuck in this coordinate, at this $x$ coordinate, that they were basically in this frame. I'm really imagining, I'm imagining it like many particles of really a fluid or smoke, so there are many. So if I slice it in that plane I will have many, not all of them because of course they are dispersed in a volume as concentrations or as density, but if I slice it, there will be few of these particles at that position.

So after $\Delta x$, basically those particles, I assume that they all move with the same speed and there is only one direction that they can move, so... well then I draw another rectangle, another area, that it tells me where they are now, those that *where* $\Delta t$ ago they were in the first... in the first surface. Maybe you see where I'm going because now that I have $\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$ I'm tempted to say, yeah, okay, but $\Delta x / \Delta t$ is a velocity. Well, it's a uniform velocity, otherwise I would need to take the limit. But even in that case I'm fine, I know... no... calculus, so in that case I could take the limit. So if the velocity is not, should velocity not be constant in time, I could still handle this situation.

But here I have that $\Delta x / \Delta t$ is basically the velocity. And another interesting thing is that basically here $\Delta x$ and $\Delta S$ identify a **volume**. And this volume is the volume that these particles basically they identified, they, whatever, in the $\Delta t$. And I know how many particles are in a given volume. If you tell me the volume, since I know the concentration or the density, I can tell you what is the absolute number of particles in that volume. And this is what I'm going to do.

So the definition here is number of ions that cross the first surface, blah, blah, normalized by the, so per unit of area and per unit of time. So I have to divide by the area and divide by the time interval. But I know how many ions are here in this box. Because it's enough that I have the density and I multiply by the volume. If I like to work with densities... if I like to work with concentration, I do the same. But there will be an Avogadro number in between.

And you see that if I do this... I think I have it here for concentration for those who are like me, more fond of moles. So here you will ask, I want to work in moles because I know that sodium is $150 \text{ millimolar}$ concentrated there. And what happens if I apply some electric field? And so they will move, and I want to use the fact that I have $150 \text{ millimoles per liter}$. So here you see that I can simplify $\Delta S$, and I remain with $C$ or $\rho$, whatever it is, the density or the concentration, times the velocity, which is simple, which is okay.

#### The Nernst-Planck Equation (Thorell Formula)

Let me do another step invoking mobility, because with mobility, I can go from velocity to force. So here, with this definition, which is called the formula of Thorel, is a guy particularly, say, for the molar fluxes, not for the particle fluxes. Look, we have to commit, but we know how to go from one world to the other.

The flux is given by the **mobility** multiplied by the **concentration** multiplied by the **force**.
$J = u \cdot C \cdot F$

And it's not so impossible, so strange, because if the mobility of this particle is very, very small because the particle is a very poor swimmer, it's very big, and Stokes is slowing him or her down a lot, then the flux will be small. If you don't have enough molecules, if the concentration is small, the flux will be small. It cannot be larger if you don't have stuff there. And finally, this is clearly, it makes more sense, the stronger the force, the stronger is the flux. This is also making sense. If I blow air, the stronger is the force that I put with my lungs, the stronger will be, the more intense will be the flux with this definition. So, and the fact that here is a linear, it's a proportional dependency, is something that I like. It's sufficiently simple.

So this is called the Thorel formula, and again, depending on your choice, if you're talking about moles or particles just be careful, connect your brain for a moment and then disconnect it and play or use units. So when you write units like moles divided by square meters divided by second... will be the unit of this flux. And you see it's a density because in the denominator you have a square meters which is the cross section. Again I don't want to work yet with the current because I want to work at some point with densities. I don't know the sections like I don't know how many particles I have. I'm happier to talk about concentrations.

So here is if you want to go from the flux to the current density. So flux is agnostic in terms of electric... electric charge. But if you want to do that it's enough if you want to go for... this is **current density**. The current density means Coulomb per second, fine, but it's per unit of area, per unit of cross area. And so you see that is per square meters, Ampere per square meters. And if I want to do that, nothing is easier. You simply have to multiply by the charge.

Again with this stupid example that I'm imagining some molecules of smoke and this... and there is some wind that is pushing them in one direction. If they are all charged, I have to multiply... if I have the flux, in order to get the current density, I have to multiply by the total charge. And in this case, I have to multiply by the charge of an element. If the element is a particle, I have to multiply by the elementary charge. Maybe the valency here. Maybe here I should write also $z$. But if I have moles, then I have to multiply by the charge of a mole. And if a mole is made of $6$ point something, $10^{23}$ particles, then okay, each particle will be charged $Q$, and I do the Avogadro number times $Q$, which is incidentally called **Faraday's constant ($F$)**, which is the amount of Coulomb per mole.

Nothing to understand here. It's simply that if you want to go to the world of electrical phenomena, electrical currents, you need to give this label to the particles. And depending on your choice, if you are in the... if you're in the... in the physicist quarter and you like densities, multiply by the elementary charge. But if you are in the moles, you have to multiply by the Faraday constant. And we will love to stay with concentration simply because it's so easy to prepare solutions and work with concentration.

So remember it will be at some point, although for a very brief moment of time, but at least now you know that the world of electronics is... could be reconciled with the world of particles swimming in a solution... ions. Because after all, ions are charge carriers. So maybe they can bring currents if they move in solutions. And that's why my neurons are firing and they generate electrical phenomena, because it's the same thing. But they're not electrons.

And actually it's even more interesting because in the... you know that electrons and even holes are in semiconductors or only metals are the only charge carriers. In electrolytes, in biological solutions, you have a multitude of charge carriers. You have magnesium, you have chloride, you have sodium, you have potassium, you have *chlorine*, you have many other ions that if they are in solution they might be positively or negatively charged just purely because of the dissociation due to water, to the properties of the permittivity of the water. So it's the same thing. And here basically we are reconsidering, we are approaching the elementary bit. We already kind of revisited the potential and now the current. So basically Kirchhoff is our friend now because we... we know that Kirchhoff laws of current and voltages... okay here are the same... currents... okay current densities... and voltages.

### Two Types of Fluxes: Drift and Diffusion

And now the interesting bits. What kind of fluxes can occur in solution? Because after all, okay, fine, this can be an arbitrary function that is very elegant mathematically but... but okay, what could it be? There can be only two types that we are going to consider. One is if the particles are electrically charged and there are electric fields, electric force fields, they are basically Coulomb electrostatic interactions. And the other kind is **diffusion**.

So that's why here there is a waterfall, because the waterfall is a **drift flux**. There is gravitation that is pulling the particles. Okay, here the particles are not electrically charged but they have a mass so it's a similar thing and they are pushed in this direction. Here you have smoke and the smoke is diffusing. There is a lot of smoke here so immediately the concentration of smoke here will be high. But after a while, just purely by thermal agitation, and by bumping in air molecules or water molecules, the ink, I'm thinking of an ink in a glass of water, or the molecules of the smoke in air, will basically diffuse. And if you wait long enough, they will be everywhere equally diffused. Unless they might interact. But normally, smoke particles, they do not interact among themselves.

If they are ions and they are unequally distributed, maybe they do both. They could diffuse, but as they diffuse purely by, again, thermal agitation, they are too much concentrated here, so randomly they would go in all random directions, but the net flux would be that they would diffuse away from the point they were concentrated. But they are the ions that were going to the cinema, so they were, for instance, if they are all with the same charge, they will start to repel. So there will be some sort of combination between diffusion and drift. And if you have not just one, but you have maybe two or three or four or $n$ types of charge carriers, things may start being interesting because they will be, each will diffuse, but they will interact with each other by electrostatic forces.

To make a long story short, we cannot easily understand how these two things combined would give rise to this $-70 \text{ millivolt}$ because over there there is the... the answer to our problem. And so we are now using this... this framework. We know how to define fluxes. This is... I told you already the diffusive and drift fluxes.

#### 1. Drift Flux

Let me consider the **drift flux**. Somehow it's easier mathematically. So I'm considering, of course, charged particles, otherwise there is no point. Coulomb will not give me any satisfaction. Coulomb only holds when the particles have this physical property that we call charge. But allow me to assume that they are uniformly distributed. So they are everywhere the same, so there is no diffusion. They might stay in solution at $37$ degrees, but overall, statistically, they will not move. What they do, they will repel and attract each other.

But let me make it easier. I'm thinking that there is an external force, and this external force, I told you, that can be related to charges by the knowledge of the electric fields. And if... since I don't like working with vectors, instead of $E$ I work with minus the gradient of the potential. So the external force acting on a certain charge with a valency that can be $2$ in case of calcium... so is the amount of charge times the electric field. Or the amount of charge with the minus... the gradient of the potential. This is the specific force field that I would like to obsess now.

So here if you like working in the... in the world of densities, and so here is $Q$ is the elementary charge of a proton and $z$ will be $2$ say for calcium, will be $1$ for sodium, will be $1$ again for potassium because they dissociate and they have unitary valency. If you like, like I do, working in the domain of concentrations, nothing easier. So this is a force, still it's Newton, but what I have to address is that I have to refer the force field or minus the... and I wonder why there is no minus here... why there is no minus? Okay, later... Avogadro number times the charge of the individual particles. So this is $z$ times the Faraday constant. And this is going to be multiplied by the gradient of the potential. Minus. Minus. And here there is the minus. So here is no minus. So I'm losing minuses, but then they reappear magically for some magical property. Apologies, I will amend the slide tonight. And I will re-upload it correctly.

So now that I have the force field, and okay, depending on which is your favorite team, I can deal with it. Let me plug it in this expression of the flux. Nothing easier. You have the mobility. You have the concentration (because I'm working in this framework). And here is the force. Of course, it's the force related to the concentration world. So it's the, let me see here. So it's $-z$... minus, and then $N_A \times Q$ is the Faraday constant. So this is the total charge. So this is Coulomb. And this is because the Coulomb... the electrical force, is a conservative force.

So, okay, it's basically done. Don't worry about the story. I think that you will not be tempted to, you will not have the urge to consider Faraday constant as Coulomb per mole. If you do, we can talk about that, but I think that that will be okay.

So this has the same unit of a flux. That means moles per square meters per second. It's not a current density. It's just the flow of particles. If you want to make them into a current density, you have additionally to multiply by $zF$, but we don't do it for the moment.

Why am I doing this? Because this flux is the flux of matter. Fine, the matter is electrically charged, and these charged particles are moving because there is an electrostatic force. Fine, but this is measuring a flux of stuff. So it's like the flux of a river. So, so, passively and, sorry, positively and negatively charged, they experience a force, and this force here I basically put it in relationship in a monodimensional case with the electrostatic potential.

What I'm trying to go... so where I'm trying to go is the following. To give you a slight bit of intuition. I have a cell and I have this electrostatic potential $V$ that I told you is negative with respect to the reference electrode. So I have somewhere a potential that I measured. It's not something that I imposed. I measure a potential. So I would love to translate, to relate electrical phenomena that are being characterized by potential to fluxes. Because intuitively I'm thinking that maybe there is something related to charges inside and outside and these charges, as opposed to what I did on the demo before, they are not glued in place. These are glued in place. See what happens if I put a positive charge, the negative is not... is... It should be kissing the negative. Instead, they are not attractive. They are glued on the table. If instead I put these, it became now proverbial. So the sodium very close to another *peer* in the cinema, they're not repelling each other. These are, just for the sake of simplicity, these are *stick*, they're glued on a table.

But in solution, everything moves. So I hope that maybe if things are moving, I can describe fluxes. And if I can describe fluxes, I can maybe sort of understand if there is any relationship between fluxes and potential. Maybe, even ambitiously, some relationship which is self-consistent. There is no external force. It's just the thing that is reorganizing, redistributing, because things are... maybe initially they're not equal inside and outside, and if they're not equal they will start giving rise to fluxes, and the fluxes are going to create an equal distribution, there will be repulsion or attraction, and at some point, $-70 \text{ millivolts}$ will come up. This is my plan. It's not entirely correct, but it's almost what we are going to do. It's not exactly how things will work.

#### 2. Diffusive Flux

Let me show you this animation and then we break for $10$ minutes.

If you don't have any electrostatic charge, any electrical charge, so they are not charged particles, they are in aqueous solutions and they are unequally distributed. Because otherwise if you kill me also for the distribution, so they are not interesting, they are not spicy. They are not charged. And everywhere is the same. Well, they don't do anything interesting.

Here you know that if they are in solution and they are not charged, they **diffuse**. Diffusion is omnipresent. So the ink in water, the smoke. And this happens because you know that there is thermal agitation, so non-zero kinetic energy of water dipoles. They are constantly agitated and they bump into each other. And they do this because they are not at $0 \text{ degree Kelvin}$ and so there is thermal agitation. And by doing this they transfer kinetic energy to the... to the particles, to the calcium ions for instance. And they do this by random isotropic collisions. Isotropic means that there is no preferred direction. So it's the same. So a dipole would bump me from the bottom or from the top or from the left to the right, it's gonna be the same. I will randomly make a step.

Probably you heard in this context the analogy with a drunk sailor... *sailor man* that is drunk and it can be... just because it's drunk he can make a step on the right or a step on the left. If it is a mono-dimensional *sailor... sailor man*, it will go randomly from one direction or the other. Here I'm basically thinking of the underlining things and this very fantastic... I will at some point I will make it nicer. This is a stupid cartoon that I made, not really implementing the diffusion equation. The diffusion equation is something that I would like to derive. The only thing that I... so here it's what it's called the Monte Carlo simulation where I'm basically considering the microscopic scale and microscopic phenomena. And here the microscopic phenomena is that they are only bumping and making random movements. In other words, I don't know whether you have ever heard of this, this is the so-called **Langevin equation**. So the actual stochastic bumps are translated into a force field that is just a random number generator in a computer.

If they start all concentrated in one spot, purely by this random, and believe me I did it, there is no direction that is preferred, you have that they were all in one spot at time zero and now they tend to be distributing everywhere in the *same* in space. This is a box so there are boundary conditions so you see that particles are not allowed to escape. And this red and blue lines are basically histograms of the horizontal and vertical coordinates. If at the time zero there were two Dirac deltas because they were all concentrated in one spot, at $t$ that goes to infinity they should go flat. So this is the concentration somehow, and the concentration should be the same everywhere. You see they did not stop moving but statistically their overall population did not change. The only difference is that they are boundary conditions so you have these two spikes at the *other* boundaries because yeah, I cannot... I make a random... if I'm here I'm only... I can only make a random step on the left because if I make a random step on the right, I hit the wall. So there it's a restricted diffusion, so you have this anomalies compared to what the diffusion equation would predict. But here there is no diffusion equation.

But the question is, after the break, can I make the flux? Can I understand how do I have to write the flux? Because here it's a bit complicated, I leave you to think of it. What is the force field in a diffusive environment. There is no... well there is a force because things started *to* move around, but what is the force field? Is it conservative?

Let's stop for $10$ minutes.

Okay. Okay, let me restart.

So this slide is a bit dense and there is one concept that I cannot make it... I cannot make it easier for you and so it's a bit disappointing for me because I wanted to show you the steps as I derived the drift flux. And in the case of the diffusion, as this is not a course in thermodynamics, I cannot come with a... because this involves statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, I cannot easily tell you what is the force field and what is the potential that is associated to the force field in the context of a diffusion.

So the elements that I clearly intuitively are there is that temperature has to play a role. So the warmer the bath, the faster is the... So the higher is the kinetic energy. So the story of the kinetic energy, which is clearly well represented in a statistical mechanical representation of thermal phenomena, is there. And the other concept that is there is the concentration. So this is something related to the concentration. If things are *unequally* distributed, then there is some sort of net force, even though the elementary forces are random and isotropic.

So this is sort of given. It follows from other principles that when you have temperature that is larger than zero, so you have non-zero kinetic energy of the water molecules, and kinetic energy is exchanged, it is as if you have an external force field which depends on the temperature. $k$ is the Boltzmann constant. And then there is this funny gradient of the logarithm of the concentration. So the two elements are there. The temperature is there and the concentration is there. And okay, the temperature, I'm happy that is here, that is proportional, so I double the temperature this force seems to double so that, okay, it could be intuitive. What it's not intuitive at all is why this has to be this potential... so minus the gradient of this function, $\log(C)$, with respect to space. But this is the potential of the force field, how this is came to be. And of course it's also more complicated to state, oh okay, so a potential exists, so the equivalent force field is conservative, but I don't venture in that concept.

So this is the exact same case for the world of densities. If you are in the world of concentrations, this is a force that has to be scaled to an Avogadro number of particles, so this Boltzmann constant has to be pre-multiplied by the Avogadro number. And you end up having this $N_A \times k$ which is called $R$ which is also called **gas constant**... is given the final expression.

So the flux was: mobility $\times$ concentration $\times$ the external force.
$J = u \cdot C \cdot F$
So the external force here is $-RT$, and then is the gradient of the logarithm of the concentration. With respect to $r$ or $x$ or whatever you want to call it. So just this... just this unidirectional, just monodimensional case. Let's call this coordinate $x$.

Something that you might be tempted to do is that here this seems to be a composite function and the derivative of the logarithm of a concentration. So this concentration we don't know what it is. It's a given or maybe becomes self-consistent but that will be later. So here you will be tempted to simplify this term. Would you tell me how? How can I rewrite this? *Analisi 1*.

Okay. $1/C$, $dC/dx$. Indeed. And you will see that $C$ is simplifying, is canceling. And I hope that you have seen this expression because this is the law of diffusion. I think it's in the next slide, but I want to just, I cannot resist simplifying this. So you have that diffusion is proportional to the gradient, which is exactly what diffusion is. Okay, yeah, I'm spoiling even myself.

#### Fick's Law of Diffusion

So if I do that, you see there is no longer concentration here multiplying because it has been simplified. And apart from these quantities that are constant, and maybe I call them big $D$, I call it just... it's a number. Then I have that:
$J = -D \cdot (dC/dx)$
So the minus comes from the idea of the... of the potential. And you know this as the **Fick's law**. I think it's Fick's law of diffusion.

If you have a profile of concentration that is like this, so moving in this direction in this coordinate you have a lot of stuff, so it's a pile of sand. Okay, if you move from left to right you encounter the pile of sand, so the more you move to the... to the... to the right the more stuff you find, the more concentrated it is. Well, you know that the pile, if it should fall or if it's not a pile it's maybe smoke or ink or whatever, will tend to diffuse from points where they have higher concentration to points that have lower concentration. To me this is a pile of sand that when it relaxes it ejects sand in this direction. It doesn't eject because that would mean spending energy to become more concentrated. So if I have nothing and then at some point I have all the ink in a glass of water, the ink will diffuse in the opposite, so this minus direction of where the concentration is increasing. The derivative of the concentration with respect to space is where the concentration is increasing. Minus is where it's decreasing. This is the law of the diffusion that you probably have seen many times, I hope in the past. It's called the Fick's law of diffusion.

And the fact that people could link this microscopic thermodynamical constant, $R$, $T$, particularly $T$, the temperature, and the mobility to this **diffusion coefficient $D$**, which is exactly what people have been measuring for decades and centuries for quantifying diffusion of particles, the diffusion of that ionic species or that molecule or hemoglobin, so whatever... oxygen... $D$ has been related, and this is due to **Einstein**. So Einstein worked out, as you probably know, the link between the microscopic mechanism, the microscopic view of Brownian motion, the thermal agitation, to its macroscopic description, which is here. Here you don't have anymore the single molecule. Here you have the single molecule, the particle... okay here you have a mole of particles. Here you don't, you don't have anymore the microscopic, you don't have the kinetic energy. So it's very powerful synthesis in a way and it's exactly what we want, what we need, because now we have diffusion and drift. Sometimes we are going to simplify that, some other times it's easier to work with the... with this full expression. It can be ugly but it's not particularly difficult now that I guide you and I gave you perhaps intuition to what this thing is. It was as expected, it had to depend on the concentration.

So you have drift and diffusion and the question now will be what do I do with this? What do I do with this knowledge?

I think we are... I don't remember this quiz or questions or whatever. Okay, so this is exactly the point. What happens if you have both? Particles that are charged and they are non-uniformly concentrated. They will both drift and diffuse. The point is that it's not trivial and it's very difficult unless maybe you could think of running a computer simulation to understand how... there will be a Monte Carlo simulation where you track individual things, how they would tend to diffuse because they are too packed, but if they are diffusing they are getting further away from their opposite charge friend and they will be kind of being attracted. But if they are attracted too much, then they will start igniting diffusion. So there will be this sort of ping-pong, maybe some sort of equilibrium, balance between these two things.

So balance would mean what? That this is exactly equals to that? Or maybe... maybe it's a thermodynamical equilibrium that means that everything is dead. So there is no flux. This is zero, this is zero. Maybe the sum is going to be zero. We're going to see that this is the way to understand why this is $-70 \text{ millivolts}$. The whole story is if they are free to move, then it's not what your intuition might have guided you in at the beginning or... or last week to say, "$-70 \text{ millivolt}$, well superposition of the effect, it's because I have a lot of negatively charged particles inside." Which incidentally is in part, it's true, it's not wrong, but it's not the reason why you have this electrostatic potential. And by the way, it's not... otherwise would not be explainable why this electrostatic potential can even change abruptly in excitable cells.

Something that, of course, has happened is that in the video, the last couple of hours there was no projection of the slides, but at least the slides you have them. Now I think I solved it. I have now understood where a bug is, but at least you have blackboard material and my voice.

### Neuroelectronics: The Real Thing

So let's continue with this chapter that is not any more preliminaries. Now it's the real thing, it's **neuroelectronics**. And I hope that now it makes sense why is electronics. It's about current, current densities, fluxes, electrostatic potentials, distributions. Not too far from what maybe some of you might have studied in the case of semiconductors, diodes, transistors, is similar, it's not so different.

So, again, as a supporting means to your study and understanding, these are the references that might be relevant for this part. Particularly both in this book and in this book, it's just one or two chapters. It's not the entire book. Instead, here you have way more stuff, more chapters are related to diffusion, drift, to the emergence of electrostatic potential across a biological membrane and how this is affected by membrane properties. And this is also another relatively general introduction on the cellular biophysics, at least the first couple of chapters.

So this is a list. It's what we are going... I don't know whether we are finishing today, most likely we are continuing next week. Let me for a moment focus on the first three things. So I would like to make it even more explicit that we are focusing on wet systems, so aqueous solutions that have electrochemical properties. So they have electrolytes, so they have ions and cations, which is just another convention to say if these are positively charged *or* negatively charged, unless I'm swapping them. They are particles that are charged and they are ionic species and they are born, they come from the dissociation of molecules in water. And again I will tell you how we do measure the electrostatic potential by electrodes, particularly with one electrode interface which is silver chloride, silver chlorinated interface.

And again I will again emphasize that our task is this tackling this $-70 \text{ mV}$ under rest, resting. What is rest? It's rest but I'm still alive, so maybe it's not thermodynamical equilibrium. And at rest I do have $-70 \text{ mV}$. For excitable cells, sometimes in a matter of less than a millisecond this electrostatic potential jumps $100 \text{ mV}$. So something here, or maybe not, or maybe something has to change rapidly over a time scale of a millisecond, or maybe not. And then I will go with other things. So I will refresh, I will tell again the superposition of the effects, I will tell that the anchor charges are fine for intuition but they are not what happens, and again drift and diffuse and I will tell you what, why, how do we use it.

Okay, first three parts.

So I'm thinking now of a world where you have aqueous solution, so you have a solvent and the solute is made of molecules that are charged. They might even be not charged. And they are, yeah, these are the ions that we are probably going to comment mostly. And they dissociate because salt, because of solvation, is this reversible reaction that happens because in water electrostatic forces are weaker. And obviously, this is an important thing. Remember that **electroneutrality** always holds, globally. Locally, it might be violated. But globally, if I put one gram of sodium chloride in one liter of water, it's going to be electrically neutral. But it will be dissociated, so in some spot I can observe electrostatic potentials that are non-zero.

This is for the tenth time. In metals you have some charge carriers, in solution you have a multiplicity of charge carriers. And there is no particular novelty to tell you that people started observing many, many years ago, $50$ years ago or more, the comparison between transistors and electrolytes, even proteins and semiconductors. However we are going a little bit more in details, more in depth, and we are going basically to study electrochemical system with electrodes. And just for... For the nomenclature, it depends on the book that you look. You have anodes and cathodes, particularly when you have, maybe not only you measure, this is supposed to be some sort of gauge, just to measure what is the difference of potential between these two points of the solution. Or maybe you want to apply an electrical potential with a battery, an electromotive force, and you make, let's say, the positive or negative electrodes are going to accumulate the opposite sign particles to that electrode. So this is the framework that we are considering.

#### Electrodes: The Silver/Silver-Chloride ($\text{Ag/AgCl}$) Interface

And about electrodes, I have immediately to tell you that like what I *tried* to stick on my chest and on my arm during the first class, we cannot use metal, a piece of metal. Well, we could, but it's different. Because electrons are not going to jump into the solution and ions are not going to be entering in the crystalline *reticulum* of a metal and will be kind of fighting and kind of finding their way in the metal wire. This is not going to be happening.

What people did, and this is the most conventional and the easiest kind of electrode to be used and to be understood, although as you can see is the most fragile, and it's definitely not the one that Elon Musk is placing, it's not the way Elon Musk is placing electrodes permanently in the brain of patients, it's called **silver chloride junction**. And it's based on this dissociation reaction. If you take silver and you put it in a solution that is very rich of *chlorine* ions, *Chlorine* and silver can bond together, can bind together, and in the process they release an electron. Because charge has to be conserved, and this electron, if by chance you have an electric wire that is closing a circuit, maybe to another electrode, through a meter or through an amplifier, so you close the circuit, this electron could or can give rise to a measurable electrical current. So an ionic current, these *chlorine* ions getting closed and binding, give rise to an ion.

So this is the perfect interface to exchange. It's like when you go to a foreign country and you have different currency, you want to pay with Euros and they only accept Swedish Crowns. Well, okay, this is making the conversion and so it's transparent to you. It's so transparent that this is an **ohmic interface** in the sense that there is proportionality between the difference of potential and the current that flows in.

Also, the opposite takes place. So again, charge is conserved if you have a block of silver that is bound mechanically or because you kept it in solution for many hours, or because it's produced by an industrial process that is called *sinterization*, that is attaching *chlorine* to the porous structure of silver, you make it porous. If you pass a current, like the battery that I was attaching a moment before in the previous slide, if you pass a current, then you may create a dissociation of *chlorine* ions that were attached to the silver metal, and they are expelled, and they are now free to swim in solution.

So it works as an interface, as a bidirectional interface, and that's why placed on my skin you could get signals, and if you attach electrodes to my brain and you apply some sort of electric current, you can excite my cells because you can create some fluxes, some current densities in terms of fluxes of ions. Although you start only with electrons. So you can measure and you can inject, read, write. And this read and write is linear in the sense that it is linear, it's an ohmic relationship. So if you apply with respect to the solution you apply a certain electric potential, electrostatic potential, the current will be proportional to how intense is the electrostatic potential.

Again please remember this the comparison with the gravitational potential. If I have two *reservoirs* of liquid, I don't know whether this helps or confuse you, if you have two *reservoirs* made full of liquid, full of whatever... wine or petrol or water whatever... and you are making their height, you create a difference of electrostatic potential. The electrostatic potential is basically referred to the height. So if they are not at the same height but one is higher than the other, then you will create the condition for a current, for a flux to flow from one container to the other. Here is the same concept and it's a ohmic relationship. Of course there is resistance because there is non-ideal, not perfect, it's not a superconductor, it's not a perfect match, one electron, well it is one electron, one *chlorine* but the... clearly resistance in the wire because it's not an ideal wire and there is a resistance... Stokes law... in the solution.

If you have sodium hypochlorite... so if you have *candeggina* at your place and you have a piece of metal wire... well don't do that because you will... well it's not ruined but it's a... if you have a silver chain or silver ring if you put it in *candeggina* it will be immediately covered by a silver chlorinated layer. And this is how we build our electrodes in the lab. There are other ways that is by electro-deposition. So we apply a specific current, so it's here, and we make the *chlorine* attached to the... to silver. So we subtract current and we get as a result silver chlorinated electrodes.

#### Pipettes and Patch-Clamp

The other element I mentioned many times... the **pipettes**. This is a close view of one machine that we use in the lab to build these pipettes. So we start from borosilicate glass that we buy and they're very expensive and they are very tiny. It's a $1 \text{ millimeter}$ or *half a* millimeter diameter made of glass, borosilicate glass particularly. And if you ever seen *of*... being to Venice and the islands around Venice, you know that you can do by heat, you can melt the glass. So if you have this tube of glass... they got a Nobel Prize for this idea... and you put it in one part where there is a filament, I don't think that you see here, but there should be here a sort of ring, and this ring is attached to a battery so when current is flowing in, because the ring has some resistance, is going to heat up a lot. If you go with this capillary inside this ring in the center it will melt.

And if you mount all of this in a system that cost about $12,000 \text{ Euros}$... it's not very cheap... in a system that has some wires, this is another sort of pulley that is pulling the two extremities of, in this case it's an horizontal puller, it's called pipette puller with a lot of originality. So if you *hit* in the center and you start to pull, the glass is melting and getting softer and getting thinner. At some point where you pull with more force and you end up having from each side this melted and very, very, very tiny capillary. The other one remained from the other side of the system. Initially it was just a cylinder inserted in the middle with this ring, it was heated, pulled, heated, pulled in a certain cycle and at the end you end up having with a tip that can be smaller than a micrometer or even smaller.

And you're familiar with this because you see this in in-vitro fertilization of oocytes, of human oocytes, where people are injecting genetic material taken from men in the oocytes by some sort of pipette. This is obviously for different reasons. And what we use this, we put here inside a very, very tiny silver wire, silver chlorinated wire, silver that stayed in the *candeggina* for overnight and we fill the pipette with a solution that is very rich in *chlorine*. So at the tip of this pipette we have a perfect interface. So we have here... this is silver, this is silver chloride and so this is connected to an amplifier, to a system, to some sort of a battery or whatever, and at the very tip here we can basically count of *chlorine* ions to be our messengers. And if you have some sort of electrostatic phenomena in the bath, in the solution, in the stomach of a cell, I can really be bringing some sort of detector very, very close, and I will be guaranteed to be able to transduce this difference of potential, this current, into a world that I can manipulate with electrodes.

And again, when you do that, you put it under, okay, in this case you need a special contrast technique. I think I show you already this. What you do, you push it into the stomach of a cell, inside. Here there are many pipettes. There are six pipettes and six neurons. And what you see is the experimenter that is changing the focus. And when I say $-70 \text{ millivolt}$ I'm referring to what the tip of the pipette is detecting with respect to another electrode which is typically called pigtail because it's a... it's a piece of wire, it's... we don't need another pipette. And this piece of wire is just to expand its surface... keeping the surface... sorry, expand its exposed surface keeping the volume small... we wrap it around and it looks like the tail of a pig. Although pigs are... well I don't think they are so curly but still.

And so when I say $-70 \text{ mV}$ it means that the difference of potential inside minus outside is $-70$, is negative, because outside by convention I say that this is $0 \text{ millivolt}$. I attach this to the ground of my amplifier so I say that is... that is zero. And so that's why I'm basically saying inside the electrostatic potential is $-70$. Now in the... today and next week I will keep indicating *in* and *out*, but at some point I will maybe drop *out*, because for me *out* means out of the cell and means zero. So here it is *in* with respect to *out*. This is supposed to be the pigtail electrode. And this is the silver chlorinated with a very trivial, very crappy drawing, a very crappy scratch.

So I would like to understand from these first principles, from drift and diffusion, the existence of this difference of potential. And basically somehow I told you that this is not only theoretical, people are measuring it, we do it all the time, by this sort of electrodes and techniques.

### The Cell Membrane as a Capacitor

And the first things that we might have to encounter is a brief discussion of what the membrane is. Because I understand that I can pinch with a pipette because nowadays I have microscopy techniques that allows me to roughly see the boundaries of the cell. I will not be able to see how thick is the membrane, but I'm able to see whether I'm pinching or not, like for oocytes. And so it might be interesting to see whether this is ringing any bell. That is something that we already know.

And the interesting thing is that these endeavours towards this $-70 \text{ mV}$ will ultimately be resolved in terms of the permeability of fluxes and ionic permeabilities. Permeabilities are relatives of mobilities and they are related to the fact that the doors are small, they're large, they're closed, they're open. So basically it's only in terms of this selective ionic permeability and ionic flows that I can understand this neuroelectronic world.

In the process, we are going to end up having a fully **electrical equivalent model** of a membrane and of the cell and of the doors and etc. Which is very useful because not only we can say that we understand better a system, an electrical system that we are maybe familiar with. I mentioned in the past hours, Kirchhoff laws of current and voltages. So all this set of things of linear network theory, electrical network theory, that is very easy, very conventional. I might review it for some of you who might be completely empty. But say you have something that it's not obviously the physical system, it's a model. And having models is essential, like it is for a civil engineer, wants to build a bridge. You don't try to build a bridge and see what happens. You have a model, you have equations, you try to combine it, and then you make predictions and you build your system on the basis of these guidance. And you will see how naturally this electrical equivalent model will come.

And this is basically where we are going. So we are interested in excitability. What is, in all the things that I said before, what makes it possible for the membrane potential to change so rapidly, and apparently with some meaning. So not only the resting potential, again, the potential at rest, rest without any stimulus maybe, rest because you are resting, you are not consuming power maybe, but you're not dead, you're at rest. And here there are electrical potentials that are maybe conveying some action. And that's why they are called **action potentials**. They are also called **spikes** because they look like needles, like spikes, like spiky... *punte*, *spilli*. And they are faster. So this is-- I show you already many times this particular recording. Let's go on.

We measure this $-70 \text{ millivolts}$ across the cell. So inside with respect to the outside. And I hope that you had a happy childhood and you played at least once in your life with oil in water. I don't know whether you had a dish or you had a glass. You probably know that oil in water does interesting thing. It basically creates some sort of spheres or circles and it's not mixing because the molecules of oil are **hydrophobic**. It always takes me a couple of milliseconds to remember what is hydrophobic and hydrophilic. Hydrophobic, I imagine, is particles of oil. They are phobic, they have a phobia for water, but it's because of this phobia that they are creating these phases. And that's why, thanks to this, that life evolved. Again, you needed to create some boundary from what is outside and what is inside. And this is the mechanism.

Of course, the membrane of a cell, of any cell, nerve cells or even pancreatic cells, muscle cells, skin cells, blood cells, white cells, is not only composed of lipids, of oily molecules. There are many, many other things interleaved into the membrane, but the properties that I'm referring to are basically mostly made of **phospholipids**. And these phospholipids, I'm just spending one word, you have only to vaguely remember that they have a **head** and they have **tails**, and the head is **hydrophilic**. Instead the tails are **hydrophobic**. And just purely by this electrostatic interaction with water dipoles, I don't have any more water dipoles around, these things thrown into the water, they **self-assemble** in membranes, which is to me mind-blowing. So you engineer something according to the rules of the game, which is physics and electrostatics, you put the ingredients there and out of the blue the lowest energy configuration is the one that creates a compartment inside divided from the outside.

Those using hydrating creams probably know that there are two kinds of stable configuration that lipids could get in water. One is what they are called *micelle*, **micelles**, where all the tails are pointing in and all the heads, hydrophilic heads, are pointing out. So they are basically shielding what they, so the tails really don't like to be in contact with water, so they try to really to escape. And they are, sometimes they are used in cosmetic products, they are very common to see this. And another very common for hydration creams is **liposomes**, also for drug delivery. So I'm just making it trivial, assuming that you never heard of liposomes, in which you have that there is another configuration in which it forms, a **double layer** is formed. So the tails are facing each other and there is an internal compartment that is formed as well. And this is the most interesting part because this double layer, phospholipid double layer, is stable. And this is what generally, just on a first approximation, constitutes a plasmatic membrane.

And the story that I told you about this very tiny, so it's a nanometer thick layer of the membrane, of this double layer, has been measured electrically. Because people started thinking, okay, there must be something, there must be a membrane. Well, this was the membrane hypothesis. And outside, I have a lot of ions. Ions are charged carriers. And then inside, I have a lot of charged carriers. So I have two compartments that are basically **conductors**. Not ideal conductors, but conductors. And in between, I have maybe something that does not allow water or other things to flow in. You see, it's very packed. It's like an army, like all soldiers. Okay, the army is a bit unhappy, comparison analogies, like a crowd, and they do not allow anything. And water cannot enter because, energetically, you will need a lot of energy to push a water dipole in, which opens an interesting reflection. If it takes a lot of energy to move something from inside to the outside, maybe something went wrong. This is not an ideal thing because I'm a cell, I need to eat. You also need to take coffee or whatever you can find from the machines here or whatever. You have to go in and out. You have to exchange even information. And if it's so difficult to enter and exit, maybe you need to have some, you have to devote some specific structures, *ad hoc* structures like doors, because going through the walls might require a bit of energy. You could do that if they push you, but it's going to be really, really costing.

But let me go back to this story that there is some conductor here, there is another conductor here, and this seems to be an **insulator**. Does it ring any bell? You have two, yeah, **capacitors**. I know that you are all experts in biophysics, but I hope that those of you who may not would maybe get this analogy. Of course, it's not a capacitor. It's definitely not a parallel planar plate capacitor. It's a biological membrane, but it behaves like, at least geometrically and also functionally, behaves like a capacitor.

So if I have, again, if I know how the electrostatic potential, particularly here, across these two plates is related to the charge, and I know that this is the basic definition of capacitance, $C = Q/V$, I know that maybe I can do, I'm in the game. So I know that for parallel plate capacitor that at some point... now this is a mathematical model. It's not the real thing, but it's useful and it's actually even beyond the good analogy. It works so nicely that if you take the formula that was derived in physics one whatever of the capacitance... like the ratio between the difference of charge or the change of charge maybe over time, let's say the difference of charge, the different distribution of charge and the difference of potential or the variation of the potential in time, then you can do this and you can understand maybe why you have $-70 \text{ millivolts}$ from inside with respect to the outside. Maybe you can guess what is the charge difference inside and outside if you know the value of the capacitance.

And the value of the capacitance is known from first principle to depend on the area ($A$). The larger the plates of this capacitor, the bigger is the capacitance, and the *closer* closely spaced are these plates (distance $d$), the higher is the capacitance. And you see here that there is the... is the permittivity. So it's the $\epsilon_0 \times \epsilon_r$. And I told you that for phospholipid *belayers* this is around seven.

So if you could, and this is how people did, if you could engineer just maybe not the real cell but if you could take this phospholipid and you can maybe put it say on water... you can assemble something that you know how large is the *surfaces* and you know the permittivity of the lipids. And you can measure electrically the capacitance. You can measure the capacitance injecting some current and seeing how the voltage is changing. So I'm thinking of the constitutive equation of a capacitor, which is $I = C \cdot (dV/dt)$. And I'm tempted to say that if I integrate both sides, I can get some sort of relationship between the voltage and the integral of the current. So if I can maybe inject some current, I can measure the voltage and I can infer the capacitance. This is one way. It's not for instance, it's not the way we do it today for measuring the capacitance of a real cell. We do it in a different way, but people did it and... and they got that it was around in the order of a few nanometers. And for me, this is brilliant.

So, one, you could calculate from first principle, okay, now you know the thickness and the permittivity, and so you can get the capacitance, or vice versa, like they did. You don't know the thickness, but you measure the capacitance. And so this is the formula that you would use. And if you are interested in the capacitance per area unit, so the so-called **specific capacitance**, I'm attached to this because I don't know how big a cell would be. It could be a small sphere or it could be a bigger sphere. I would love to have some value that is a specific physical quantity. So specific means per unit of area. And the number that you can burn into your brain, although in humans, in human cell, people found at least one paper found slightly different value that was half of this value... so it's **$1 \text{ }\mu\text{F/cm}^2$** (one microFarad per square centimeter).

So you see it's per square centimeter. So the total capacitance is... will be known if you specify the area, otherwise it remains this specific quantity. And here you see I only use the nanometer... $6 \text{ nanometer}$... $10^{-9}$ because it's milli-micro-nano... so it's three... and $10^{-9}$. And here I think it's $8.85 \times 10^{-12} \text{ Farad per meter}$, this is $\epsilon_0$, and $7$ is the relative permittivity. And you get roughly for free that you get $1 \text{ microfarad}$ which is what you measured experimentally.

And something that you could do is you could get this $70 \text{ millivolt}$ interpreting this $\Delta V$ and $\Delta Q$ as the delta... as a difference in space. So with the two... so not necessarily in time but in... okay that's another story. And here you will see that if you plug the value of $1 \text{ microfarad per square centimeters}$ you can see that a membrane that is $70 \text{ millivolts}$ charged is actually storing this amount of current per unit of area. This is kind of interesting *per se*, it doesn't answer still my question saying, but why you have $-70 \text{ millivolts}$. Because here you have, this is given. You could also reason the opposite way. You say if this is a difference in electrical charge around the membrane, then you will have $-70 \text{ millivolt}$. Okay, but why? Why did you end up with this value of the charge? Nonetheless this knowledge that is basically taken from elementary physics or from electrical engineering allows you to make prediction, to make calculations, to make... to *deeper* your understanding of a biological system... of any cell by the way, not only *your*... of neurons. OK, in humans, people found a smaller value.

#### The Membrane as an RC Circuit

And you might remember that people are fond of studying **RC circuits**, where you not only have a capacitor, but you have a capacitor in parallel with a resistor, which is, by the way-- So this is an analogous to having your bathtub or your sink where you wash your face in the morning with a hole. So you have a certain height, and the height is equivalent to the potential that you have on the capacitor. And you have some dissipative system that here is represented by a leak that is contributing to removing the liquid. But anyway, to make a long story short, you probably know that this electrical circuit, for reasons that now I don't want to bother you with... in order to do that you have to derive the equation that describes $V$ as a function of all the other quantities, and you will find the usual boring differential equation, but you will find that the exponent that makes me happy, there is $e^{-t / (R \times C)}$. So the $RC$ of an RC circuit is the **time constant ($\tau$)**.

And so today we measure the capacitance by analyzing the time constant, the decay time constant of a real cell. Now it makes no sense because you would say, "Yeah, okay, but here there is a membrane. Where is the leak?" Okay, maybe you intuitively could say, okay so it's not only the membrane, there is... there are some resistors. And there are some resistors and so even if we don't know necessarily the value of the resistor, in one measurement we can see how fast or slow the system is relaxing and we get... we measure the capacitance. But in the old days they did it in a... in a different way because they did not have any... they did not play necessarily with intact cells or they did not play with cells like neurons. They do have resistors.

Let me skip this and let me, before breaking, let me just remember what I wanted to tell you. Okay, this I told you already. And so with this, I wanted to show you two graphs... This is the demo, I did it already, so you can go, you have the link if you want to play once. But I wanted to show you what I did having fixed, glue, anchored charges in free space, at least in a *B-dimensional* settings.

So, I tried to answer this question, and what I did is I myself randomly, so it's a *B-dimensional* system. I have one part of the plane that I call outside, I have one part that I call inside, and I dispersed here inside and outside positively or negatively charged ions. So it's me clicking and I did that, I did this. So negative, you see there are many negative inside and there are very fewer negative outside. And I put a little bit of, I sprinkled a little bit of positively charged ions. I know I should do it. This sucks. Graphically is not very appealing but I didn't have time and today one could think of doing these things with a... with a Python library that is called Manim. If you are fond of YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown, whatever. So he's actually using this library for making beautiful animation.

Okay I'm not so skilled but I wanted to do the following: if I have a certain distribution of charge then for every point I could measure all the distances and I can calculate the potential in that point. And here is what I did. Clearly you have... you have a sort of thermal map. You have in every point you have a color with a gradient scale that tells if the potential is positive or negative. Now forget about the unit. I... I only care about the negative or positive. Here I actually put random number for distances. I put random numbers for the charge. I did not expect to actually get $-80$ or $-70$. I just wanted to see if... now the question is, so you see the potential is negative inside and it's positive outside. But what I'm measuring with the pipette is a **difference**. So I put the pipette here and I put the other reference electrode here and I take the difference. Here you cannot see, so let me convert this into... Okay, here you are seeing it. So from this point to this point, the difference is $-42$. Okay, so the point is it's not the absolute values, it's the difference that should go to $-70 \text{ millivolts}$.

And if you do it in 3D, maybe it's easier. Inside you have this negative potential and outside they are positive. So this height should be $-70 \text{ millivolts}$ negative. So here should be lower than here. So when you take the difference you have something that is already minus, minus something that is positive so it remains minus. So here you would be... you would be tempted to conclude, okay, that's the explanation. That's why you have $-70 \text{ millivolts}$. You have a lot of negative charges inside.

Let me show what happens and then we break. Sorry that I'm abusing a few more minutes and we stop early. I will not do another $50$ minutes later.

If I put a lot of positively charged ions only outside, very little inside... so this is the dual case. Intuitively I like to think $-70$ it's negative. In reality is the difference between inside and outside. And this difference would still give rise to negative numbers if I have not only a lot of negative inside and a lot of positive outside, but also if I have a lot of positive outside and little positive inside. So the difference, the height, will still be negative. So you would have the same explanation for an unequal distribution of positive ions. So you will be at square one. Why the hell you have $-70 \text{ millivolts}$?

The problem is **anchored charges** and I hope that I did not spoil but in the past two hours I gave you some elements where we are heading, otherwise it would be too boring even if with some culmination in a moment, well probably next week.

So we break for $10$ minutes and we continue until 5:45.

Okay, so there are two key points. The first is that ions are not anchored, they are not stuck, they are free to swim, free to diffuse and to drift, to experience drift forces due to their own electric fields. And the other element is that there is a very thin insulating membrane across which we measure the electrostatic potential, the **transmembrane potential**. Transmembrane because it's across the membrane, inside with respect to the outside.

And what I wrote here is again the concept of capacitors. Capacitors are, the formal definition I think is that you have a set of coupled conductors where the distribution of charge and the distribution of electrostatic potentials are linked, are linked by a property that is called capacitance. And if you can think of this relationship and you divide both terms by $\Delta t$, so you're thinking of this change as a change over time, maybe you will recognize that here $\Delta Q / \Delta t$ is a charge divided by time, is a **current**. So somehow the two elements, the two worlds, the two concepts, currents, current densities... Okay, fluxes, but say this is basically currents and capacitance, capacitors that are able to integrate currents in order to generate the potential are the ingredients that we are, as electronic engineers or whoever we are familiar with. If not, I tell you these are very powerful concepts. And it took centuries to get to this relatively simple and elementary picture. Of course it's not over because it's not so trivial now to combine everything and to say, "Okay, so tell me how $V$ comes up." So maybe I tell you, apologies that this is capacitance, maybe I call it with this symbol, is that these ones are concentrations. These are concentrations.

So, summary of the facts.
1.  Everything is isopotential, but locally you can lose the electroneutrality.
2.  You have multiple ionic species.
3.  These ionic species, although we don't really understand how, but they must be unequally distributed inside and outside, otherwise we would not have, we would have no electrostatic potential.
4.  And the membrane *belayer* is impermeable to water and ions, so it is acting as a capacitor, as an integrator of current.
5.  And okay, this membrane potential that we measure, again, remember it's a difference of potential inside with respect to the outside, and the outside we consider zero.
6.  And again if the cell is not dead, and I'm repeating over and over again so there is no thermodynamical equilibrium... and you will hate me in a moment because in a moment I'm going to take this as an hypothesis at least temporarily... but say if I'm not dead it's $-70 \text{ millivolts}$.
7.  And in excitable cells things are even more interesting, more spicy. This changes, it goes $-70$ to $+30$ and back.

#### Ionic Concentrations

So first I start with telling you what people did in terms of quantifying the ionic concentrations inside and outside cells, starting from the most famous experimental preparation that is the **giant axon of the squid**. So there is a squid which is this invertebrate that you may have eaten, maybe it's a small one. So it's a giant axon... this guy here, if you dissect it, has a very big thing that is a cell that you can possibly put an electrode inside and you can measure things inside and outside. It's not the axon of the *giant* squid. The giant squid is a marine monster, probably it exists, it's very rare, but this has not been done on marine monsters. It has been done on squid, normal, but they have a big axon.

And this is the situation expressed in millimolar:
* **Potassium ($\text{K}^+$)** is concentrated a lot **inside** ($400 \text{ mM}$), and not that much outside ($20 \text{ mM}$).
* **Sodium ($\text{Na}^+$)** is the **opposite**. Sodium, you have a lot of sodium **outside** ($440 \text{ mM}$) and a little bit of sodium inside ($50 \text{ mM}$).
* **Chloride ($\text{Cl}^-$)** is like sodium, you have a lot of *chlorine* **outside** ($560 \text{ mM}$) and a little bit inside ($52 \text{ mM}$).
* And basically **Calcium ($\text{Ca}^{2+}$)** is very important because basically calcium is outside, there is a little bit ($10 \text{ mM}$), but **inside** basically it's almost **empty** ($10^{-4} \text{ mM}$). You heard probably at Nauseam in other courses that calcium intracellularly is considered a second messenger, is one of the most important actors in biochemical cascades. Well, it is because inside it's basically empty, so as soon as you start having some free calcium ions inside, the cell knows that it means something and it has mechanism to detect that.

Now I tell you something that I hope you will remember for the rest of your days, how to mnemonically remember these, because this is extremely important. In Italy it works nicely. Abroad I had to mention that I was Italian, that for lunch I was preparing pasta, which is the only thing of just a few things that I can cook. And in the water of pasta after, so before, well that's another thing, before or after water boils, I was putting sodium chloride. So, *sale da cucina*. Of course, it's not the only salt, but this is what I have at home and I put it in my boiling pan when I prepare pasta. So, if I taste this, it's salty, okay? It's trivial.

Now the disgusting part starts. In order to remember that outside you have a lot of sodium, so you have a lot of sodium chloride, allow me this, also it *also* for chloride. Imagine that you go... this is disgusting, but I could not find a better alternative. You will maybe propose me. So you go do, you do sport, you sweat a lot, and you lick your own sweat. It's salty, right? So closed... so outside the cell, presumably in the intercellular space. So this is inside and this is outside. In my perverse mind, the sweat is what is outside. So I lick my sweat, I lick and I taste it salty. I'm licking my *exacellular* medium, which is not wrong, of course. What is wrong is that by no means the other salts will taste differently to my tongue. But I hope that you will remember. So if I think, okay, I taste my sweat, it's salty, so it means that **outside I have a lot of sodium**. I have a lot of sodium and inside I have a little bit.

**Potassium is the opposite.** And you will tell me, have you ever tasted potassium chloride? No. I think it's not even... I don't know whether it's *eatable* if I take potassium chloride. I don't know. So potassium chloride is the opposite. You have very little potassium outside and a lot of potassium inside. Chloride, just because of the same story, goes like the sodium. So you lick, it tastes salty and that tastes salty because it's outside in the extracellular space you have a lot of ions.

It's important and we will see and it's intriguing that you were thinking, wait, I thought that you had a lot of negatively charged ions inside, but no, it seems that you have mostly positively charged ions, but you cannot really conclude what is what, because this guy here is $400 \text{ millimolar}$, it's a lot, and it's inside, instead sodium is $440 \text{ millimolar}$ outside. And we said that we should not take for granted the story of anchored, glued charges. So I don't think that we can conclude anything about this. But this is key for the next point.

#### The Role of Selective Permeability

The next point, so the spoiler, at the end, we are going to understand the electrical potential across the cell membrane because, okay, there is an heterogeneous distribution of charges. This we have understood. I think I repeat it too many times. And this, however, it's not enough. What matters is the fact that the **membrane is not permeable to all ionic species in the same way**. It's as if some of you would not be able to come out from the door, and the door would be only making those that are particularly slim or whatever... would be selective. So the permeability across the membrane is partial. And despite the fact that maybe you have, you see the most beautiful person from the other side, so you're attracted because you're blue or red. Okay, that's maybe not a good comparison. So you are attracted because of a drift or because of diffusion, yet you are not going to cross it because the membrane is not permeable.

And things are getting complicated because we are not talking about only one ionic species. There are multiple. The second point is that we are not talking about the thermodynamic equilibrium because you're not dead, but I will start with the dead cells. And because of these distinct concentrations. So the fact that you have a lot of sodium outside, it's a lot of sodium outside because if I lick my skin, it's salty. So it means outside the cells in the intercellular space, you have a lot of sodium and a lot of potassium inside instead is what makes these $-70 \text{ millivolts}$. So it's a collective thing.

This has been, for me, very complicated to appreciate intuitively. I can see why maybe if the charges are not anchored, if they are all concentrated unequally, say, there will be some diffusion, but then after diffusion, diffusing I will get far from my partner and then I will be attracted or repelled. So this I can feel. So there can be drift, diffusion, ping-pong, this I get it. What I don't get is, okay, but what does it matter? What does it mean that if you have a membrane that is semipermeable, then across the membrane you will have a difference of potential. So an unequal distribution say of positive and negatively charged.

So here I did the same cartoon that helped me. Not this one but something similar helped me. So again this is... it's purely a Monte Carlo simulation in the sense that I fake and I put the equation of motions so it's like a Langevin dynamics. There is no gravity. What I did here I only... if I remember correctly I only put... so I put friction of course, I put the random collisions so that I could get diffusion, and if I'm not mistaken I'm only taking care of attraction and not of repulsion. But definitely this is not what a proper molecular dynamical simulation would take into account. So if two particles are getting very, very close $1 / r^2$ will go to infinity. I don't have this and at some point I clip so that two particles can... can be one after the other. There are methods from physics where physicists already know how to do this system. But it was already computationally tough, although there are not many particles, to create a stupid movie like this.

So the difference is that we start with the same situation, that you have a lot of positively and negatively charged particles from one side of the membrane, and from the other side of the membrane you have almost nothing. In one case, which is this one, the membrane is as if it's not there. It's permeable. There is no selection. Here, black can cross, red will not. Red will stay on the left. And the numbers that you see below, if I'm not mistaken, are the number of black particles. We will see in a moment. So I launch the simulation and you will see what happens. And you can make a bet what happens after a sufficiently long amount of time what will be the distribution of the red or the black, whether they will be equally distributed or not.

You can see that here the red are crossing, here the red cannot cross. So it seems that because they stay here, they stay behind, the black will say, oh wait, you didn't come with me, then I'm attracted. I cannot, you don't come, you don't move the cloud, oh, sorry. I don't move the entire cloud, I don't move the entire cloud of things at once. Here it's as if the center of mass of this smoke cloud, the black and the red are basically diffusing and they are bringing each other. Here this cannot happen because the membrane is semipermeable. And this is the entire story.

So in a couple of seconds, or maybe $10$ seconds or $20$ seconds... this number here is the number of frames, the number of step of the simulation. It's something for me to show me that things were moving. Here, you end up having, I think it's the red. No, sorry, it cannot be the red, because otherwise it would be zero. So the black here will be $50/50$, because there is no selection. Here will not be $50/50$. And you can already appreciate it. OK, it's fluctuating because it is a stochastic simulation. It's a numerical simulation of a system that is, say, it's at the equilibrium, but in a statistical sense. But here you actually see that there is a so-called breaking symmetry, instead on the left. So the fact that the membrane is opposing the passage from one ionic species is enough to create an unequal distribution, a dynamical unequal distribution. So something has to do with membranes and something has to do with permeability, but I have no idea what permeability is. There I'm talking about fluxes in the open space, so there is no permeability. Okay, maybe I could imagine that the mobility, I could make the mobility at some point in some, although it's a property of the molecule, but I could maybe say at some point the mobility goes to zero. But it's not very elegant because it seems that I have to tweak something. In other words, electrically, I'm talking about that here, there is no resistance. So the current can flow in both directions. Here there is only... some ionic species have a non-infinite resistance. So here the resistance is zero, here for some ionic species selectively is infinite. So there you cannot change. Of course if it's not infinite but it's very large, still you would have this breaking of the symmetry.

#### Ion Channels, Pumps, and the Electrical Model

Okay. So the doors that I anticipated to you are physical doors, physical pores, and these pores are called **ionic channels**. I don't know whether in the module of Professor Zoli you have heard of something like this. Are proteins... they are called surface proteins just because they are expressed at the surface of the membrane. So you actually see here the double layer, the phospholipid double layer, *b-layer* whatever. And these proteins are not inside the cell, they're not outside, they stay in between. They stay in a part... in... in a domain that is called lipophilic, so it's philia for lipids. So... So they love being with lipids. And these proteins might have a different distribution of charge, of electrical charge, so that they are stable there. So you cannot pull them away unless using a big force. What they can do, they can slide horizontally on the surface of the membrane so much that this cartoon, this conceptual model, was called for many years, I think it's still called **fluid mosaic**. So the membrane is a collection of particles and structures, lipids, and it is as if they swim on the surface of the sea like kids when they have these inflatable things, *braccioli* or *salvagente*. Of course if you want to go down or up you have to spend a lot of energy and so naturally this does not happen.

But if these proteins are creating some sort of space in their inside due to their three-dimensional conformation, and if you are an ion, you can move freely or not freely inside the pore, then this is like a passage of ions across the membrane with a bridge, with an easy path that does not require a huge amount of energy like the lipid *belayer* would require this strain. And in fact our colleagues went through a pore and not through the walls.

So these are pores and it turns out that you have specific pores only permeable to sodium ions, they are called **sodium channels**, and you have pores that are only selective to potassium *channels*, that are called potassium ions, they are called **potassium channels**. You have *chlorine* ion channels, you have some ion channels that are permeable to all ionic species, and you have some other mechanism of transport, which they are not passive transport like these two cases, where you basically, if you have the energy to do that, or simply by purely diffusion, by purely thermal agitation, can go in and out without problem.

Of course if you have a $-70 \text{ millivolt}$ difference of potential across the membrane it means that you have an electric field, then it might be easy or difficult depending if you are positively or negatively charged ion species. Say for sodium ions will be very easy because ion is concentrated a lot outside (because I lick and I feel tasty and my *swept* is salty) and so it's positive. Inside is more negative than the outside. So I can move along the electrochemical gradient, the electrical gradient. Well it's also electrochemical because I have a lot of sodium outside and a little bit inside. So by diffusion as well as by drift I will be able, if I'm a sodium ion, I will be able to enter. If I'm inside will be more difficult because I will move against both the diffusion and the drift.

But this is still passive. There are active mechanisms, like I cited a couple of hours ago, called **ionic pumps**. And these ionic pumps, I imagine them like some sort of mechanism. And they have been described mechanistically like some sort of rotating things or machinery, molecular machinery, that are able to exchange against the electrochemical gradient. So for instance, sodium I told you it's very easy to flow in, but very difficult to get out. But if you have ATP, so if you eat your bananas and chocolate and you have adenosine 3-phosphate molecules that can be used as a currency for converting, so they are used for storage of energy, and you can spend this energy, you can activate from one cycle this ionic pump, and you can extrude three sodium ions, and you pull in two potassium ions. Remember that you have a lot of sodium ions outside and a lot of potassium ions inside. So this truly requires a lot of energy. It's not passive.

So this is important because these ionic pores or ionic channels, the pumps we will not probably consider. We will not discuss it in details anymore. But the ionic pumps are to me resembling a metal wire or a **resistor**. If I'm an ion, I can go along. There is a capacitor here, but this capacitor must be some sort of parallel between the capacitor and there are these resistors. Because if I'm an ion, I can, yes, I can impinge in the membrane here and I will hit the insulator. Okay, if I'm approaching here and I'm a positive ion, just by electrostatic induction, I will attract my opposite from the other side. But this is going to be only a so-called displacement current. But if I just move a little bit on the right in parallel to this capacitance, I have a resistance because ions can flow and this will be a transport current where the current is physically, explicitly moving. It's not just an indirect effect because I'm getting close to the membrane and because of my charisma, I'm attracting somebody from the other side. No.

Yes, there will be some movement but this is not a transport current. A transport current I need to have pores.

So this is another model, and it's some sort of physical wire. Of course, the channel is very tight. It maybe will make only one sodium, one potassium ions at a time, so it will be tough for the ions to pass. It's kind of tight, so friction will be large, or at some molecular scale will be not easy to have two or three sodium ions going simultaneously. But it still matches perfectly the definitions of the **Ohm's law** that says that you have some relationship between a difference of potential and the transport current that is proportional one to the other by a resistance.

So this is just to set ideas for what an equivalent mathematical model would be. So this is what is called an **electrical equivalent model**.

So if I'm a sodium or whatever, potassium, so here it's different, so this is a potassium ion. This is inside, this is the outside. Potassium is highly concentrated inside and very little concentrated outside. In fact, if I *lick*, I *lick* the sodium, not the potassium. I know, this is the fault of that comparison. And *cross* the membrane through this resistance. No, sorry, this is, sorry. Inside the cell and outside the cell, ions can move freely. Maybe they encounter some friction because they have a mobility and this mobility is not infinite. So they do encounter friction due to the viscous property of the medium. And if one ion wants to go from inside to the outside, if there are the conditions to do *so*, it can do it provided there is a bridge.

The conditions would be that you have an electrochemical gradient. You have a lot of potassium inside, so diffusive. In terms of diffusion, you will diffuse. This is the **Fick's law**. The movement, the diffusion will happen from points where there is high concentration to points where it's lower concentration, minus the derivative of the concentration with respect to space. But if you can do that, well, here I need the pore. Otherwise I will hit the insulator, this capacitor.

So the capacitor is there and it's a sort of property per unit of area. So this is clear, it's fine, but they are not only capacitors, they are resistors. Some of them are resistors. And if you allow me to make a first approximation of many, many approximations that I will do and that I did already so far, this resistance is much larger because here it's a very tiny space. So although we call the Stokes law... we only call it $\lambda$, we did not open and say, okay, what is in the geometry of the hole... the *map*... the particle moving... you can probably understand that here moving inside here it's different than moving freely inside and outside. So by comparing this resistance that is placed in parallel to this series of resistance that are... that are placed here inside in series and outside in series, maybe I can approximate that this is like a shortcut. So it's basically negligible. It means that if I have an electrolyte, in solution, the conductivity of the electrolyte is such that, OK, the conductivity is not infinite, but it's as if it's a piece of copper without resistance, with very low resistance, both inside and outside.

So by the way, now you get the **RC circuit**. So the suggestion that I told you that you could measure the properties of the membrane by looking at capacitive transients, now you get it for free. Because you do have resistance and capacitors as I *introduced* the pores.

Okay, there is the membrane potential and this seems to be it. And the question is now, are we done? So basically you have a series of parallel of capacitors and resistors. Maybe you have one resistor per ionic species, but I don't see how you get $-70 \text{ millivolts}$. I can maybe say or see that if you put here charge and you have $-70 \text{ millivolts}$, I know that after a while because of these resistors you will not have any more $-70 \text{ mV}$. You will decay to zero. You will have leak. So this is not clearly enough.

And it's not enough because this is not the perfect model of the pore. It's not the perfect model because yes it's acting as a resistor, but inside here and outside you have two solutions made of different ionic species. It's like Alessandro Volta in his battery. He had two environments with different solutions. And they are joined together. So when they are joined together, there is a battery. There is an effect of an endogenous generation of electric potential.

But this is blah, blah. Let me, probably next week, but let me at least tell you what will be the plan to understand it.

### The Path to the Nernst Potential

So ions are flowing across the permeable membrane, and these two compartments are made of unequal distribution of concentrations. And we only, only, where is it? Yeah, I only simply tell you the strategy and we do it next time.

What we are going to derive is the **Nernst potential**, which is at the **equilibrium**. So now I am really assuming in the next three minutes that we are dead. And the rest we'll see.

So if you have diffusion and you have drift, one thing that you can try to do is you can say in general one molecule or one mole could experience simultaneously drift and diffusion. So what you might have to do is understanding what is the total flux. The total flux is $J_{diffusion} + J_{drift}$.

Let's think that we only have one ionic species. We only have one ionic species. We will not do it. I simply tell you what the plan is. One ionic species. The membrane is permeable to this ionic species. And what else do I need? I need that I consider that it's over. I'm dead. And basically we are at the **thermodynamical equilibrium**.

If we are at the thermodynamical equilibrium, it means that nothing is moving. Nothing is moving. So the **total flux is going to be zero**.

So next week, what I will try to do is to say that everywhere across the membrane, the membrane is... I want to keep the membrane because I want to have two points where I will try to attribute a membrane potential, and the potential is there, so it only awaits to be manipulated, *massaged* in some way. I anticipated we will have to integrate it.

And the assumption that is clearly wrong, although we will see later on that is useful, is follow what Nernst, one of the greatest biochemists and biophysicists *who* existed, what he assumed. He said, okay, in general you have both terms, but it's zero. So zero means not that the drift is compensating for the diffusion, it's that one is the opposite of the other, because it's the *total* flux that is zero.

$J_{total} = J_{drift} + J_{diffusion} = 0$
$\implies J_{drift} = -J_{diffusion}$

This is maybe a little bit, it's not counterintuitive, because for me I see it, the total flux is the superposition of both. If you have an ionic species that is charged and *unequally* distributed, I both drift and diffuse. I cannot do only one. And if I say, look, it's dead, so there is no net flux, that means that this is zero. I cannot assume, it would be wrong to assume that I only do diffusion or I only do drift. No, it's their combination that is zero.

And you can, next week, we are going to, if you want, you may try to do it by yourself. If you assume that one is equal *to* the opposite of the other, you end up with two terms with an equation that is, it is a differential equation, but it's by no means boring and not trivial and not usual. You have this stuff, so this is cancelling out because it's there. So that's why I wanted to keep it like that. Okay, so mobility and concentration are done. Although concentration keeps existing here. But it's interesting that the mobility goes out of the way. So it doesn't matter if it's a big, fat ion or a small, slim ion. Apparently it doesn't for this picture. In the more realistic picture, it does.

And then you have... So this is a number, this is also a number. You have this term and *these* terms that are basically one minus the other. What do you do with this? We'll see you next time. The spoiler is we may try to cancel the derivative, integrating both sides. If you're brave, try, and I'm happy to answer questions.

Okay.




# Class 4 Transcript

## Introduzione e Annunci

Bene, un po' troppo... ora c'è il volume. Ora provo a parlare a più bassa voce, un po' mettendo il microfono più basso. Buongiorno. Una domanda di servizio: ma voi Teams lo usate o vi fa proprio schifo?

Perché ogni tanto, nei giorni della settimana scorsa, ho buttato lì qualche informazione, tipo quella che avete una finestra limitata durante il mese di dicembre per prenotare il vostro *spot*... *slot*... durante le sei sessioni d'esame tra gennaio e febbraio. Ma anche articoli, o notizie, o link che potrebbero essere di vostro interesse.

Credo due settimane fa di averlo fatto con un tema che un vostro collega mi aveva menzionato, quello della ricerca sulla coscienza, quindi il correlato elettrofisiologico della coscienza. E vi ho messo dei video, degli articoli e dei libri, dei link a libri. E così ho fatto un paio di giorni fa con questo articolo di ***Nature Communication*** che era stata ripresa la notizia da quest'altro sito, ***IEEE Spectrum***.

Buttateci un occhio, potrebbe essere interessante. Non me ne frega niente che facciate *like*, ma [è] per sapere se siete vivi e se siete potenzialmente *engaged*, potenzialmente interessati.

### Quiz: Distribuzioni Ioniche

In particolare, c'era uno stupido quiz che vi ripropongo, perché solo in due di voi mi hanno dato conto. Ed è questo qua.

Nel frattempo che vi registrate... *for the main time for the attendance tracking*... *this is the question*. *It is: what is the ionic distributions inside and outside?* *You remember the disgusting, but I hope, lifetime memory-effective hack that I suggested to you.* *So you have these four possibilities.* *You should tell me which one is the correct one.* *And of course I'm talking about a biological membrane, and so 'in' and 'out' is around the inside and outside the membrane, the plasmatic membrane of a living cell.* *Which do you think it is?*

*So, how many of you think that is the first one?* *So, you have more sodium outside than inside and you have more potassium outside than inside.* *Who thinks the second is correct?* *The third one.* *Fourth one.* *There is maybe a fifth possibility.* *I think those of you who raise your hands at the second one, indeed, you're right.* Il sodio e il potassio, la loro concentrazione è l'una l'opposto dell'altra.

*And it will be very clear to you why the swap is relevant.* *You will remember without problems.* *The fact that you have a lot more sodium outside is sort of easy to remember with this disgusting thing that I suggested to you.* *Well, you could think... I think I spotted in my slides, I forgot, there is a gentle kitten, like a cat that is licking his paws instead of me licking the extracellular solution.* *But anyway, it's salty, you have a lot of sodium outside and a little bit inside.*

## Il Potenziale di Membrana a Riposo (Resting Membrane Potential)

So, *let's go back on what happens*. Il nostro compito è capire perché questo dannato **-70mV** è il cosiddetto *resting membrane potential* (potenziale di membrana a riposo). Chiamiamolo equilibrio, ma non sto parlando di equilibrio termodinamico, sto parlando di condizione di riposo (*resting condition*). E questa condizione di riposo ha significato quando si parla di cellule eccitabili, dove il potenziale di membrana può cambiare. Ma comunque, in tutte le cellule, anche quelle che non sono in grado di cambiare rapidamente il potenziale di membrana, si ha un potenziale elettrostatico negativo all'interno rispetto all'esterno.


### 🧬 Diffusione e Deriva (Drift)

Per capirlo, dobbiamo partire da qui. E l'ho già, nelle ultime two classi, penso di aver provato a spingere, in particolare la settimana scorsa, ho provato a spingere questa idea: le cariche non sono fisse, sono libere di muoversi. E c'è deriva (*drift*) e diffusione (*diffusion*). E una volta che derivano (*drift*), in qualche modo innescano (*triggering*) la diffusione, e viceversa: man mano che la diffusione avviene, allora si iniziano ad avere campi elettrici.

Quindi, questa è la tendenza naturale di ogni cosa a diffondere e a concentrarsi equamente ovunque nello spazio. E questo è il fatto che le particelle sono elettricamente cariche. E quindi, se si muovono, potrebbero percepire le forze di Coulomb, e si stanno effettivamente muovendo in un campo elettrico.

Quindi, qui stiamo parlando della formazione di un potenziale elettrico nello spazio attraverso una membrana. La membrana è semipermeabile. E il punto di partenza... in realtà si può vedere in due modi... ma il punto di partenza è che si ha una concentrazione diseguale di ioni, e quindi, un potenziale elettrico si genera "gratuitamente". Questo è il principio delle batterie, delle batterie chimiche.

Quindi, si ha una distribuzione diseguale. Bisogna spendere energia per rendere le cose diverse all'interno e all'esterno. E gratuitamente, o non gratuitamente, ma in cambio di questa energia che hai fornito... (ecco perché mangiate banane, cioccolata, eccetera, solo per stabilire e mantenere nel tempo questo potenziale elettrostatico attraverso la concentrazione diseguale)... allora si hanno questi fenomeni elettrici.

Iniziamo prima con questo, che è sbagliato. Vedrete perché è sbagliato, l'ho già menzionato: è il fatto che stiamo invocando la condizione di equilibrio che, vi ho detto, [c'è] solo quando sei morto. Lasciatemela prendere comunque.

### 🧮 Preliminari Matematici: Integrali e Taylor

E gli elementi che... i preliminari matematici che ho bisogno di rinfrescare o di ricordarvi è questo semplice integrale definito della funzione $1/x$, che è molto famosa. Ed è... l'integrale di $1/x$ è il logaritmo di $x$ ($\ln(x)$), la cui derivata è l'integrando. E poiché è un integrale definito, ha gli estremi. E quindi, il teorema fondamentale del calcolo integrale dice che si prende la primitiva, la si calcola nell'estremo superiore meno la primitiva calcolata nell'estremo inferiore... *lower interval element*.

Quindi, nel caso del logaritmo, si finisce per avere la differenza di logaritmi, e il logaritmo è una bella funzione tale che la differenza di logaritmi è il logaritmo di un rapporto. La somma dei logaritmi è il logaritmo del prodotto. E questo è quello... solo per ricordare vagamente... vi ho già detto che questo è quello che... mi sono dimenticato di portarvi il righello, il regolo calcolatore. *In the old times*, gli ingegneri non avevano nemmeno calcolatori digitali, e facevano prodotti e divisioni semplicemente sommando cose, sommando misure. Quindi sommavano o sottraevano quantità, a condizione che i numeri, le lunghezze, non fossero codificati linearmente: erano codificati come logaritmi, e potevano fare gratuitamente rapporti e moltiplicazioni.

E le altre cose a cui accennerò e lascerò come esercizio a voi sono le espansioni di Taylor in serie di polinomi, che sono semplicemente arrestate al primo ordine. Quindi, tra poco, forse tra un paio d'ore, vi darò il compito, e dovreste farlo da soli senza problemi: come approssimare una funzione attorno a un valore in cui la funzione è calcolata, è nota. E sapete che è il valore di quella funzione più... è una linea retta, è la linea tangente... è la nuova variabile indipendente e la pendenza, quindi la derivata prima calcolata in quel punto.

### L'Equazione di Nernst

Quindi, questo è il signor Nernst, un altro gigante, che ha seguito questi semplici calcoli. L'ipotesi è che ci sia equilibrio, e per semplicità stiamo considerando solo una singola specie ionica. Non mi interessa se sia sodio, potassio, ma solo una: calcio, magnesio, solo una. Ed è all'equilibrio.

Equilibrio significa che il flusso totale ($J$) è uguale a zero. Vi darò più tardi un altro paio di elementi per capirlo intuitivamente, perché in effetti, potreste forse pensare che la cosa giusta da fare sia dire che la diffusione deve essere uguale alla deriva. Questo non catturerà l'equilibrio. Quella è un'altra condizione. È qualcos'altro. Non è... questo sarebbe un bilancio. Invece, voglio investigare cosa segue dall'idea che "tutto è all'equilibrio".

Quindi, il flusso totale è zero. E se il flusso totale è zero, significa che uno è meno l'altro. Perché il flusso totale è la somma dei due flussi. Ed è la somma... vedrete tra un momento... a causa della conservazione della massa. Ecco perché avete questa somma. Ma dovrebbe essere semplice, anche intuitivamente, capire che i flussi sarebbero composti linearmente, additivamente, dai due termini.

Quindi, lasciatemi prendere questa ipotesi e lasciatemi considerare solo un caso unidimensionale, monodimensionale, in cui ho una membrana semipermeabile, ma la uso solo per suddividere lo spazio, fondamentalmente in tre domini, ma non vi annoierò con ciò che accade all'interno della membrana. Ha uno spessore che non è infinitesimale. È finito, anche se piccolo.

E quella somma è zero, il che significa che uno è meno l'altro. Ho l'espressione matematica di ciascuno di essi. Le abbiamo derivate, la maggior parte di esse... non per la diffusione. È solo parziale, perché vi ho detto che non posso spiegarvi facilmente la forma... la forma analitica del potenziale per quel campo di forza.

E ce l'ho qui. Questo è il flusso di diffusione... scusate, il flusso di deriva... no, diffusione (*diffusion flux*)... e questo è il flusso di deriva (*drift flux*). E vedete che siete tentati, e lo faremo, siete tentati di semplificare quegli elementi che sono comuni e sono, ovviamente, non-zero. Quindi la mobilità ($u$) e le concentrazioni ($C$) sono in generale non-zero. E accade già qualcosa di sorprendente: che nell'espressione che rimane... Quindi, questa è l'ipotesi, e questa è... deriviamo logicamente tutti i passaggi... è che la mobilità scompare. Come se la mobilità non giocasse alcun ruolo, il che è un po' strano. Ma nel caso dell'equilibrio, sì, è così. Non importa se sei uno ione grasso o magro che si muove in una soluzione acquosa con tutti questi dipoli d'acqua, quindi il guscio di idratazione (*hydration sheet*). Non importa, solo le condizioni di equilibrio saranno le stesse.

E vedete qui, non conosco la concentrazione ($C$) e non conosco il potenziale ($V$). Quindi non è propriamente un'equazione differenziale che posso risolvere. Ma almeno, poiché vedrete che c'è una derivata qui ($dC/dx$) e una derivata qui ($dV/dx$), forse se quell'equazione è vera, sarà vera anche, per linearità, la stessa equazione dopo aver applicato il segno di integrale a entrambi i termini, a entrambi i lati dell'equazione.

E prendo questo integrale attraverso l'intervallo di integrazione, che si estende, descrivendo la membrana. Vedete $x_{in}$ e $x_{out}$. Quindi ho rimosso $u \cdot C$, e non ho fatto nient'altro. Spero di non aver dimenticato il meno. Sì.

Quindi, è facile, perché qui questi sono... perfetti. Quindi l'argomento di questi integrali sono differenziali perfetti. Quindi è già la derivata, e l'integrale e la derivata si annullano... voi non sarete... ma non siete matematici, anche se siamo nell'edificio di matematica, quindi dobbiamo stare attenti. Non potete semplificare questo. Questo non è realmente un rapporto ($dC/dx$). È una notazione di Leibniz per le derivate, ma non vi è permesso farlo.

E di nuovo, per il teorema fondamentale del calcolo integrale, $RT$ viene portato fuori. È solo una costante. Allo stesso modo $Z$ e $F$, non cambiano all'interno della membrana. E ciò che rimane è l'integrale di una derivata, quindi la primitiva è il $\ln(C)$, e qui la primitiva è $V$. Calcolo ciascuno di essi in ciascun estremo e sottraggo.

Quindi questo è $\ln(C_{out}) - \ln(C_{in})$, e finisco per avere questa espressione.

$$\Delta V = V_{in} - V_{out} = -\frac{RT}{ZF} \ln\left(\frac{C_{in}}{C_{out}}\right) = \frac{RT}{ZF} \ln\left(\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}}\right)$$

Quindi mi chiedo, forse alcuni di voi hanno tentato durante la scorsa settimana questo calcolo. Non è complicato. Non c'è nient'altro da ipotizzare. Poiché è una differenza di logaritmi, si può calcolare... si può riscrivere come il rapporto delle concentrazioni.

Ed è per questo che è assolutamente fondamentale che l'unica cosa che dovreste ricordare del logaritmo... diciamo, della funzione logaritmo di $x$, è che attraversa l'asse, l'asse orizzontale, a $1$. E per l'argomento che è maggiore di $1$, è positivo. E per l'argomento che è inferiore a $1$, è negativo.

Perfetto, proseguiamo.

Sto facendo del mio meglio, ma a volte è dura... e dovreste parlare nel caso siate spaventati.

Ora, questo è davvero importante, perché il rapporto $C_{out} / C_{in}$ è questa cosa su cui sto iniziando a insistere. Non mi interessa se ricordate 400 millimolare fuori, 50 millimolare... Quello che conta è che ricordiate cosa è più grande, se *in* o *out*.

### ⚡️ Applicazione dell'Equazione di Nernst agli Ioni

Quindi, se stiamo istanziando questa equazione, assumendo che questo [$C_{out} / C_{in}$] sia noto e questo [$\Delta V$] non sia noto, per il **sodio (Na$^+$)**: il sodio all'esterno è più concentrato che all'interno, quindi questa quantità [$C_{out} / C_{in}$] è positiva. Quindi siamo qui [argomento > 1], quindi il logaritmo è positivo.

$RT$, qualunque cosa... quindi $T$ è in gradi Kelvin... *states at room temperature*... $Z$ è 1. Quindi, posso dirvi che questa cosa qui, $RT / ZF$, che potreste anche scrivere in modo equivalente come $kT / Zq$ se venite dalla famiglia dei fisici invece che dei chimici... è lo stesso. Potete vedere nella lezione passata elementi per andare da un lato all'altro. Fondamentalmente, $R$ e $F$, la costante di Faraday e la costante dei gas... *Riemann*... costante dei gas, sono parenti stretti.

Quindi, questa quantità per $Z=1$ (la valenza del sodio, che è solo 1, la valenza è 1, ha solo 1 carica elementare, positiva), questa quantità a temperatura ambiente è intorno a **26 millivolt (mV)**.

Quindi, prima di tutto, dovreste imprimerlo nel vostro cervello: questo è millivolt. Ovviamente, il logaritmo di qualcosa è adimensionale. E ha senso che sia il logaritmo di qualcosa che è adimensionale. Quindi questa quantità [$C_{out} / C_{in}$] non ha dimensioni. È un rapporto tra due [concentrazioni] millimolari. E quindi le unità si annullano, non è più una quantità fisica con misure fisiche. Quindi va bene. È una garanzia che siamo sulla strada giusta.

E quindi, sì, questo è millivolt. In effetti, questa differenza di potenziale all'interno rispetto all'esterno è in millivolt.

Non so se qualcuno di voi ha una calcolatrice o anche sul vostro telefono cellulare. A volte avete, se lo inclinate nell'altra direzione, la calcolatrice scientifica dove potete calcolare i logaritmi. E se ricordo correttamente, 400 diviso 50... potremmo farlo semplificato... No, non posso farlo perché questo non è un logaritmo in base 10, quindi non posso fare logaritmi senza una calcolatrice.

Se qualcuno di voi ha un log... una calcolatrice e fa per me il logaritmo di $400 / 50$, di sicuro dovreste ottenere un numero positivo, perché il numeratore è più grande del denominatore. E vedremo, moltiplicando questa quantità per 26 millivolt, vedremo qual è il potenziale elettrico che avrete attraverso la membrana se avete una concentrazione diseguale, come avete, di ioni sodio.

Posso dirvi che è intorno ai **50 millivolt**. Quindi penso che questa quantità [$\ln(400/50)$] sia circa 2 punto qualcosa, o giù di lì. *What was that?* Okay.

Quindi... 26, 25... Okay, non è -70 millivolt. Quindi sono deluso. Ma è molto intrigante, perché in questo modo abbiamo una sorta di indizio, il primo passo per capire perché si hanno fenomeni elettrici, in particolare l'insorgenza di un potenziale elettrostatico per una distribuzione diseguale di cariche, il che non è banale.

Questa non è l'unica storia, perché prima di tutto, non si ha una singola specie ionica, e non si ha l'equilibrio. Ma l'equilibrio... lasciatemelo discutere tra un momento.

### 🔋 Il Potenziale di Nernst come Batteria

Quindi, equipaggiati con questa conoscenza, quello che fondamentalmente avete di fronte è un modello matematico. Avete una membrana, avete una distribuzione di ioni, e fondamentalmente avete una **batteria**, come la pila di Daniell o la pila di Alessandro Volta. E questo è anche chiamato... quindi è l'equazione di Nernst, ed è chiamato potenziale di Nernst (o potenziale di equilibrio) per ovvie ragioni. Ed è specifico per quello ione.

E ora vi darò i numeri per il sodio, per il potassio, per il cloro, per il calcio. L'unica cosa che dovete sapere è l'ammontare della concentrazione all'interno e all'esterno della membrana. E, naturalmente, approssimativamente, e spero che ve lo ricorderete per il resto della vostra giornata... L'unica cosa che sarete in grado di dire, anche senza ricordare o senza conoscere i numeri, è se questo potenziale di equilibrio è positivo o negativo per diverse specie ioniche.

Proprio perché ho iniziato a stressarvi con questo: per gli **ioni potassio (K$^+$)**, che vi ho detto sono l'opposto... quindi, il sodio lo leccate e sentite salato all'esterno perché c'è molto sodio fuori e poco dentro. Per il potassio è l'opposto. Quindi avete molto potassio dentro e poco potassio fuori.

Quindi quel rapporto, $C_{out} / C_{in}$, invece di essere maggiore di 1, per il potassio è **inferiore a 1**. Inferiore a 1 significa [logaritmo] negativo. Non va... L'argomento è ancora positivo. È solo il rapporto che è inferiore a 1. È ancora una quantità positiva, quindi non stiamo violando alcuna... matematica, quindi non stiamo superando il dominio di questa funzione. E siamo in questa parte [argomento < 1] dove il logaritmo è negativo. Va molto rapidamente verso il negativo. Quindi probabilmente penserete che sono molto fiducioso che forse -70 millivolt provenga dal potassio. Ovviamente, non può venire dal sodio.

E okay, qui c'è quello che ho già detto. 300 gradi [Kelvin], che sono circa 20 gradi, 25 gradi [Celsius]. Quindi è... sapete che i gradi in Kelvin... beh, è tipo zero gradi [Celsius] quando siete a -273 Celsius. E quindi $T$ è in Kelvin. Quindi questo è in gradi Kelvin. Ma comunque, 26, 25 millivolt è la cosa da ricordare quando il denominatore $Z$ è 1. Per il **calcio (Ca²$^+$)**, sarà più piccolo. Sarebbe 13 millivolt, perché avreste un numero due sotto. Il magnesio sarebbe lo stesso, ma non parleremo del magnesio.

Quindi alcuni di voi hanno la calcolatrice. Potreste provare, ma altrimenti vi darò... Ma l'unica cosa, vedete, il potassio è l'opposto del sodio. Quindi per il potassio, di sicuro, questo potenziale di equilibrio sarà **negativo**. Il sodio sarà **positivo**. Il **cloro (Cl⁻)** è un po' strano perché $Z$ è **-1**. Quindi avete un meno. Quindi dovrebbe essere, diciamo, 50 millivolt, o forse sarà 60 millivolt. Ma in realtà, poiché il $C_{out} / C_{in}$ è maggiore di 1, ma c'è questo meno di $Z$, la valenza, perché è carico negativamente... Quindi questo [$\ln(C_{out} / C_{in})$] sarà positivo, ma a causa di $Z=-1$ il potenziale sarà **negativo**. E questo [per il Calcio] sarà positivo perché vedete, fuori ne avete davvero molto. Quindi probabilmente sarà molto grande. Forse non così grande perché il logaritmo non sta crescendo... sì, sta crescendo e va all'infinito, ma non cresce così velocemente.

### 🔢 Valori dei Potenziali di Nernst

Quindi ecco i numeri che potete ottenere, giusto una volta nella vostra vita per fare questo calcolo con un logaritmo, che, tuttavia, dovrebbe essere verificato incrociando [i dati] con la vostra intuizione, con questo grafico del logaritmo.

E quindi eccolo:
* **Potassio (K$^+$): -77 mV.** Dannazione, non è -70.
* **Sodio (Na$^+$): +56 mV.**
* **Cloro (Cl⁻): -68 mV.** Vicino, ma non quello giusto.
* **Calcio (Ca²$^+$): > +100 mV.** (più di 100 millivolt)

E tutte queste batterie, a seconda che il potenziale sia positivo o negativo... puramente per convenzione, ho scambiato il simbolo, il simbolo elettrico, solo per convincervi che uno è positivo all'interno rispetto all'esterno, e a volte è negativo. Ciò significa che sarebbe positivo nell'altra direzione. Ma non importa. È solo per quelli di voi non necessariamente familiari con questo simbolico puramente convenzionale... Quindi il simbolo del componente elettrico, solo per dirvi cos'è.


### 🤨 Un Potenziale, Molti Ioni

Quindi sto solo... spero di non eccedere. Mi direte se sono troppo teatrale. Quello che volevo trasmettere è che non può essere -70 millivolt. Quindi il potenziale di membrana a riposo non può essere, o non dovrebbe essere, o in linea di principio non dovrebbe essere, il risultato di una sola specie ionica se all'interno e all'esterno si hanno molti ioni.

E quindi, qui, questo [l'equazione di Nernst] è molto potente, ma ci lascia con una domanda, che è: come li combino? Come... li medio? È la media aritmetica? È un qualche altro modo per combinarli? Perché non so come farlo, ma vorrei considerare una cellula in cui ho sodio, potassio, cloruro e calcio dentro e fuori. E vorrei sapere, okay, perché se prendo due elettrodi, uno dentro e uno [fuori], perché misuro -70 millivolt?

Quindi questa è una chiave. Ecco perché ve lo sto presentando, nonostante il fatto che le ipotesi siano, lo sottolineo, l'ipotesi principale è che tutto sia all'equilibrio.

Un momento fa ho fatto un errore. Invece di chiamarli potenziali di equilibrio, li ho chiamati **potenziali di inversione** (*reversal potentials*). Forse tra un'ora vedrete perché è un nome legittimo, perché questi sono anche chiamati potenziali di inversione per una singola specie ionica. Per il momento non è chiaro. Inversione di cosa? Inversione forse di qualche flusso, ma in quali condizioni, visto che stiamo pensando all'equilibrio o alle condizioni di riposo? Quindi non è chiaro, ma sarà chiaro.

Quindi, deve essere una combinazione. Ma come?

### 📜 L'Equazione di Elettrodiffusione

Prima vorrei dirvi molto brevemente perché la storia... perché alcuni di voi potrebbero essere infastiditi dal fatto che molto rapidamente ho finito per dire: "se è equilibrio, allora metto il flusso totale a zero e uno è meno l'altro". Alcuni di voi lo accetteranno, ma forse sto parlando a quelli che... no, non ci credono, vogliono vedere.

Quindi farò un passo indietro e dirò: lasciate che vi parli dell'**equazione di elettrodiffusione**.

Quindi, in generale, non sto parlando di nessuno stato stazionario (*steady state*) o di alcun equilibrio. E l'unica cosa che sto invocando è la **conservazione della massa**. La massa non viene distrutta né creata. E se ho una soluzione... *accurate*... acquosa, posso fondamentalmente... permettetemi di considerare per semplicità solo un caso monodimensionale. E ho un punto. In un punto, potrei avere i flussi ($J$), potrei avere le concentrazioni ($C$), potrei avere i potenziali elettrostatici ($V$), se ce ne sono. Posso caratterizzare... Quindi tutte queste quantità che ho menzionato dipendono dallo spazio ($x$). Forse dipendono anche dal tempo ($t$). Ma dipenderanno sicuramente dallo spazio.

E come ho fatto per il flusso, lasciatemi prendere di nuovo una superficie che in questo momento non è infinitesimale. Forse è piccola. La chiamo $\Delta S$, è la superficie. È una superficie di sezione trasversale. E prendo, nell'altro caso, stavo pensando alla definizione di flusso, e stavo misurando il tempo $\Delta t$, e poiché la velocità... questa formula... *neural*... che collega le velocità alle forze, e poi i flussi alle forze e alla velocità... qui sto solo pensando a $\Delta x$.

Quindi in questo $\Delta x$, copro un certo volume tra $x$ e $x + \Delta x$, e lì sto affermando che in questa scatola, le cose non saranno distrutte o concentrate. E non c'è niente che sia come... diciamo, per cubi fatti di qualche materiale elastico, non c'è modo di gonfiare il volume o di... Quindi sto pensando a una sorta di elasticità per cui posso infilare più roba dentro, una sorta di induttore o condensatore equivalente, in questo mondo. No, è solo la porzione del volume. **Ciò che entra deve uscire.**

Questo è il motivo per cui sto, di nuovo, invocando Lavoisier con questa storia del "nulla si crea, nulla si distrugge". In un $\Delta t$, di nuovo, $\Delta x$, e qui posso calcolare, esprimere quante particelle ci sono a un certo istante, $t + \Delta t$. È la concentrazione... lasciatemi fare per una specie ionica... la concentrazione ($C$) moltiplicata per il volume ($Vol = \Delta S \cdot \Delta x$). Se il volume è espresso in litri, quindi se la concentrazione è espressa in millimolare, devo stare attento che il volume che sto moltiplicando sia espresso in litri, ma niente di sbagliato in questo.

Quindi questa quantità di particelle al tempo $t + \Delta t$ deve essere uguale a quello che erano un momento prima, al tempo $t$, **più** quelle che sono entrate dalla porta **meno** le altre che sono uscite dalla porta.

$$C(t+\Delta t) \cdot \Delta S \cdot \Delta x = C(t) \cdot \Delta S \cdot \Delta x + J(x) \cdot \Delta S \cdot \Delta t - J(x+\Delta x) \cdot \Delta S \cdot \Delta t$$

Questo è semplice perché è unidimensionale, quindi per convenzione prendo come positivi i flussi, qui flussi generici, quando puntano nella stessa direzione di $x$. Ecco perché qui ho messo un più e qui ho messo un meno. Vedete, è a $t$, entrambi a $t$, che è il passo precedente, ma qui è a $x$, quindi all'ingresso, e qui è $x + \Delta x$, che è all'altra estremità.

Se fate la stessa cosa per un caso tridimensionale o anche bidimensionale, ovviamente dovete prendere in considerazione un piccolo cubo e sapete che potete avere afflusso (*influx*) e deflusso (*outflux*) da tutti i lati possibili. Qui è semplice, è monodimensionale. Entri ed esci.

Quindi, questo è tutto, fondamentalmente. Questo sta traducendo quella frase: "nulla si crea, nulla si distrugge". Quindi significa che qualunque cosa misuro ora deve essere qualunque cosa fosse prima, più e meno le nuove particelle e le particelle che ho perso. E vi ricordo che qui moltiplico per $\Delta t$ e $\Delta S$ perché il flusso stesso è per unità di tempo e per sezione trasversale di area.

Ho riscritto la stessa equazione lassù e vedete che $\Delta S$ può essere semplificato. Questo è indipendente dalla mia scelta della sezione trasversale. E ciò che rimane è il $\Delta x$ sul lato sinistro e il $\Delta t$... beh, $\Delta x$ è... sì, il $\Delta t$ sul lato destro.

Quindi posso dividere... posso moltiplicare e dividere entrambi i lati per $\Delta x$ così come per $\Delta t$. O sposto $\Delta x$ da sinistra al denominatore a destra, o $\Delta t$, lo sposto da destra al numeratore, lo metto nel denominatore sul lato sinistro.

$$\frac{C(t+\Delta t) - C(t)}{\Delta t} \cdot \Delta x = - (J(x+\Delta x) - J(x))$$
$$\frac{C(t+\Delta t) - C(t)}{\Delta t} = - \frac{J(x+\Delta x) - J(x)}{\Delta x}$$

E sapete, ora sono molto tentato di prendere il limite per $\Delta t$ e $\Delta x$ simultaneamente che vanno a zero, perché quelle quantità assomigliano esattamente a un rapporto differenziale. È la definizione di una derivata.

A sinistra, vedete che è sul tempo. È una funzione di $x$... $x$ va bene, qualunque cosa. Ma è una funzione di $t$, e $t$ è calcolato in $t + \Delta t$ meno qualunque cosa fosse calcolato in $t$. E poi al denominatore, avete l'ammontare di questa variazione. A destra, avete la stessa cosa, a parte il meno. E la funzione è una funzione considerata dell'altra quantità. È il primo argomento, $x$, calcolato in $x + \Delta x$ meno la funzione calcolata in $x$. E nel denominatore, avete $\Delta x$.

Prendete il limite e ottenete la derivata parziale. Non potete usare il simbolo della derivata totale perché queste non sono derivate totali.

E ottenete quella che è chiamata **equazione di elettrodiffusione** che fondamentalmente collega i flussi e come cambiano nello spazio, a come la concentrazione sta cambiando nello spazio e nel tempo.

$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial J}{\partial x}$$

È un'equazione differenziale alle derivate parziali e in generale è molto difficile da risolvere. E potete inserire la deriva (*drift*) e la diffusione (*diffusion*) in quella parte [$J$], perché non avete altri flussi.

La storia di sommazione, o in altro possibile modo di combinarli, viene da questo, da quello che vi ho mostrato: il flusso di particelle che entrano ed escono. Okay, potrebbero entrare per diffusione e potrebbero uscire per diffusione, e potrebbero entrare per deriva (*drift*) e potrebbero uscire per deriva. Quindi è a questo livello che... se volete fare le cose... quindi qui è generico, ma dovrei continuare ad aggiungere e sottrarre tutti i modi possibili, i flussi possibili. In questo caso, è deriva e diffusione. Non c'è altro modo.

Quindi non c'è niente di più profondo in quella somma della conservazione della massa, che è descritta sul lato destro da questo bilancio di ciò che entra e ciò che esce.

Quindi potete, per esempio, riscoprire l'equazione di diffusione se prendete solo uno dei flussi. Quindi sto considerando che le particelle non siano cariche, quindi è solo un flusso. E forse l'avete vista. Quell'equazione è ciò che è chiamata l'equazione di diffusione. E quindi fondamentalmente questa equazione di elettrodiffusione è un caso più generale della, generalmente, equazione di diffusione. Può essere usata quando avete anche particelle cariche.

E sapete già che allo *steady state* avete una distribuzione costante. Quindi potete calcolare qui, potete dire: *steady state*, matematicamente, significa che le cose non stanno cambiando, non dipendono dal tempo perché sono costanti nel tempo. E quando fate la derivata rispetto al tempo, ottenete zero.

$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = 0$$

Quindi finite per avere che la derivata seconda spaziale della concentrazione è zero ($\partial^2 C / \partial x^2 = 0$). Ciò significa che deve essere una funzione lineare. E poi avete le condizioni al contorno (*boundary condition*).

Solo per rendervi chiaro da dove vengono le cose e perché per il momento, e anche per il resto del corso, non mi sto avventurando nell'elettrodiffusione perché è difficile. Non so come risolverla. Potreste risolverla. Potete risolverla numericamente. E sospetto che in un corso che avrete nel secondo semestre quest'anno, dal professor Pierpaolo Palestri, potreste vedere questa equazione in termini di simulazioni numeriche di sistemi elettrochimici. E quelli di voi che hanno un background in semiconduttori, fisica dei semiconduttori in elettronica, fondamentalmente hanno visto qualcosa di molto simile per i portatori di carica in un semiconduttore. E le analogie con gli elettroliti e con le soluzioni acquose sono molte. Ma okay, dimentichiamoci di questo, non è cruciale.

### 💡 Modelli Elettrici: Legge di Ohm e Canali Ionici

Quindi qui la domanda è, okay, sembra che per un canale ionico... ho provato la settimana scorsa a dirvi che questa è una specie di descrizione corretta. È solo un resistore, solo un pezzo di metallo. O se volete, devono essere... alcuni ioni devono incontrare qualche attrito. Quindi la legge di Ohm... *falls through*... vale. Quindi la... $V$ è uguale, la resistenza per la corrente. Quindi questa è la **legge di Ohm**.

$$V = R \cdot I$$

che, tra l'altro, posso anche riscrivere così, se mi permettete:

$$I = \frac{1}{R} \cdot V$$

E forse, se mi permettete, posso solo ridefinire questa quantità. Invece di essere una resistenza ($R$), potrei essere più a mio agio a parlare di **conduttanza ($G$)**.

$$I = G \cdot V \quad \left( \text{dove } G = \frac{1}{R} \right)$$

E in effetti questo sarà... ma puramente perché non mi piace avere $1$ diviso qualcosa. E anche perché se avete uno o due di questi pori e sono in parallelo, intuitivamente ha perfettamente senso che la conduttanza complessiva della membrana sia più alta rispetto al caso in cui avete un solo canale ionico.

Quegli esperti in teoria dei circuiti... ma lo rivedremo più tardi, forse alla fine di oggi o la prossima settimana... Ovviamente, quello che sto invocando è che avete un circuito con resistori in parallelo. La resistenza totale non è la somma. Ricordate che è $1 / (1/R_1 + 1/R_2)$, se questo è $R_1$ e questo è $R_2$. Quindi questo significa... ed è più intuitivo dire... $G_{totale}$ (o $G_{equivalente}$) è $G_1 + G_2$.

Mi piacerebbe rimanere in questo mondo, ma è la stessa cosa, è assolutamente equivalente. La chiave, tuttavia, è che abbiamo visto che se la membrana è tale che si ha una distribuzione diseguale di ioni, di concentrazioni ioniche, allora c'è una sorta di batteria da mettere da qualche parte. Non so dove metterla, onestamente. La metto in parallelo? Perché in effetti, il potenziale di Nernst è in parallelo. Quindi metto queste cose, le attacco qui in parallelo.

Questo è rilevante perché potrebbe essere che con lo stesso linguaggio e strumenti e matematica e fisica dei circuiti elettrici, io possa finire per capire perché avete -70 millivolt. Che è, alla fine, quello che accadrà.

Quindi non è solo un resistore, è una combinazione di quelle due cose. E devo fare un passo contro questa ipotesi di equilibrio che ho fatto finora.

### Oltre l'Equilibrio: L'Approssimazione Ohmica

Quindi, in questo momento, sto ancora considerando una singola specie ionica. Sto considerando una membrana semipermeabile, ma **non sono all'equilibrio**. Quindi non metterò $J = 0$, e non dirò che uno è meno l'altro.

Quindi l'unica cosa che posso fare è guardare intensamente (*to pair intensely*) quell'equazione, che non è realmente "corrente uguale qualcosa", anche se $J$... vi ho detto che potete convertire i flussi in densità di corrente moltiplicando per $ZF$, la valenza e la costante di Faraday.

$$J_{tot} = -uRT \frac{dC}{dx} - uCZF \frac{dV}{dx}$$

Quindi se dovessi moltiplicare, come farò tra un momento, $ZF$ su entrambi i lati, avrete $ZF$ lì e qui... okay, quindi è un gran casino, ma c'è il potenziale ($V$). Quindi non è troppo diverso da un resistore secondo la legge di Ohm. E in effetti, è qualcosa che ha una sorta di attrito. Ma per il momento, è troppo complicato da vedere. Non posso davvero scriverlo in un... non posso identificarlo e dire: "oh sì, qui, tutto questo è $G$". No, non c'è linearità.

Quello che posso fare, posso iniziare a osservare, fare alcune ipotesi drammatiche e provare a "massaggiare" questa equazione.

Quindi la prima cosa che faccio è fattorizzare $u \cdot C \cdot ZF$.

$$J_{tot} = -uCZF \left( \frac{RT}{ZF} \frac{1}{C} \frac{dC}{dx} + \frac{dV}{dx} \right)$$

Quindi, se lo faccio, vedete che ottengo questo $RT / ZF$ qui. Quindi qui non c'è nulla da capire. Ho solo... ho deciso di... se volete, dividere e moltiplicare il primo termine di questa somma per $ZF$... in modo da... l'avevo al denominatore... perché vedete, non c'era $ZF$ lì. Quindi ho dovuto moltiplicare e dividere affinché le cose rimanessero equivalenti. E poi ho... potevo fattorizzarlo perché $ZF$ ora è al numeratore di entrambi i termini.

E voglio farlo perché voglio anche rimuovere la concentrazione $C$, perché vorrei rendere questo $dV/dx$ "nudo". Non mi piace se c'è roba davanti. Anche se è puramente... beh, non sono numeri perché $C$ è una funzione e potenzialmente è una funzione del punto. La concentrazione potrebbe cambiare nello spazio.


Dopo questa fattorizzazione, quello che posso fare è dividere entrambi i lati per $u \cdot C \cdot ZF$. Quindi, fondamentalmente, in altre parole, ho preso questa roba e l'ho portata al denominatore del lato sinistro. Ma dato che c'ero già, ho moltiplicato $J$ per $ZF$. Devo moltiplicare e dividere, altrimenti non sono autorizzato a chiamarlo "uguale". Ma se lo faccio, okay, al denominatore otterrò $Z^2 F^2$. Per favore, provate a farlo una volta nella vostra vita per ricrearlo, perché all'esame potrei chiedervi di ri-derivare questa roba. Ed è solo... l'unica cosa che dovete... beh, dovete essere equipaggiati con l'algebra e dovete essere in grado di scrivere l'espressione di ciascun flusso. Ma per il resto non è niente, è solo una manipolazione, è solo una manipolazione tipografica.

$$-\frac{J_{tot} \cdot ZF}{u C (ZF)^2} = \frac{RT}{ZF} \frac{1}{C} \frac{dC}{dx} + \frac{dV}{dx}$$
$$\frac{J_{tot}}{u C ZF} = -\frac{RT}{ZF} \frac{1}{C} \frac{dC}{dx} - \frac{dV}{dx}$$
*(Manipolazione per arrivare a...)*
$$\frac{J \cdot ZF}{u C (ZF)^2} \approx \frac{J_{Ionica}}{u C Z^2 F^2} = -\frac{RT}{ZF} \frac{d(\ln C)}{dx} - \frac{dV}{dx}$$

Faccio questo perché questo, $J \cdot ZF$, è una **densità di corrente ($I$)**, ed è simile alla legge di Ohm... beh, almeno alla parte della legge di Ohm. Questo è qualcosa che non so esattamente. $u$ è una mobilità, $Z$ è una valenza, $F$ è la costante di Faraday, e okay, $C$ è la concentrazione.

E qui, di nuovo, mi ritrovo con una derivata, quindi differenziali perfetti. Quindi sono tentato di, di nuovo, **integrare entrambi i lati** attraverso la stessa membrana di prima.

$$\int_{x_{in}}^{x_{out}} \frac{I_{ionica}}{u C Z^2 F^2} dx = \int_{x_{in}}^{x_{out}} \left( -\frac{RT}{ZF} \frac{d(\ln C)}{dx} - \frac{dV}{dx} \right) dx$$

E coglierete la mia arroganza in un momento, perché non vado così lontano. Sì, okay, sul lato destro è facile, perché quello è un differenziale perfetto. E tra l'altro, sembra, dopo questa manipolazione molto sciocca, molto stupida, sembra molto... almeno questa parte... assomiglia molto al potenziale di equilibrio di Nernst.

$$\int_{x_{in}}^{x_{out}} ... = -\frac{RT}{ZF} [\ln(C_{out}) - \ln(C_{in})] - [V_{out} - V_{in}]$$
$$\int_{x_{in}}^{x_{out}} ... = \frac{RT}{ZF} \ln\left(\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}}\right) + (V_{in} - V_{out})$$
$$\int_{x_{in}}^{x_{out}} ... = E_{Nernst} + \Delta V$$

Ma **non siamo all'equilibrio**, e infatti, questo è solo un pezzo. Non è più $V = E_{Nernst}$.

E qui, di nuovo, ho due scelte. La prima che vi presento è chiamata, per ovvie ragioni, l'**approssimazione ohmica**. Ed è un'approssimazione. Anche l'altra sarà un'approssimazione, ma è un po' più elegante. È l'equazione di Goldman che vedremo più tardi.

Ma nell'approssimazione ohmica, fondamentalmente dico quanto segue: **all'interno della membrana, penso che il flusso ($J$) sarà costante.** Non dipenderà da dove ti trovi nella membrana. Lo immagino come... prendo un canale ionico, e in qualche modo sono uno ione che attraversa il canale ionico, e il flusso (che è di nuovo definito come numero di particelle o moli, millimoli, per secondo per quadrato... qualunque cosa, micrometro in quel caso, o qualunque cosa sia) sarà indipendente dalla posizione.

Se posso farlo, posso portarlo fuori [dall'integrale].

$$I_{ionica} \cdot \int_{x_{in}}^{x_{out}} \frac{1}{u C Z^2 F^2} dx = E_{Nernst} + (V_{in} - V_{out})$$

Questa quantità $1 / (u Z^2 F^2)$ è solo un numero, quindi è una costante, non dipende dallo spazio. L'unica cosa che rimane dipendente dallo spazio è la concentrazione ($C$). Ma, okay, questo è un integrale definito, finito, quindi sarà un numero, okay? Quindi questo è un numero, questo è un numero.

Quindi è: corrente (okay, densità di corrente) moltiplicata per un numero, uguale a qualcosa. Corrente moltiplicata per qualcosa... okay, quindi, scusate, è come qui. La corrente moltiplicata per qualcosa è uguale a qualcosa che dimensionalmente è un potenziale elettrico.

Qui avete $V_{in} - V_{out}$ che viene da quel termine $dV/dx$. L'altro è esattamente il potenziale di equilibrio di Nernst. Solo la forma, l'espressione matematica... non è all'equilibrio. E infatti, qui non è zero. Se fosse zero, sarebbe equilibrio.

Quindi, qui, fondamentalmente avete:
**Corrente $\times$ Resistenza = $\Delta V + E_{Nernst}$**

Okay, anche se questa [Resistenza] è brutta e non so cosa significhi, sarà fissa. E qui avete il potenziale di Nernst con un meno...
*(Riorganizzando i termini)*
$$I_{ionica} \cdot R_0 = (V_{in} - V_{out}) - (-E_{Nernst})$$
*(Assumendo $V_{out} = 0$ e $V_{in} = V$)*
$$I_{ionica} \cdot R_0 = V - E_{Nernst}$$

E questo è, se volete, il $V_{out}$, il potenziale elettrostatico esterno, lo chiamate riferimento. Lo chiamate zero. Quindi è il potenziale intracellulare ($V$) meno il potenziale di inversione ($E_{Nernst}$) uguale alla densità di corrente ($I$) moltiplicata per qualcosa che assomiglia a una resistenza ($R_0$).

Quindi questo è veramente un sistema "fatto in casa" (*home-made*), perché sto solo assumendo che vada così. E quindi questa quantità, su cui non cercherò nemmeno di elaborare di più perché dipende dalla concentrazione... Quindi non è come in un metallo, in un conduttore, dove sapete che la resistenza dipende dalla resistività ($\rho$), è proporzionale a... quindi moltiplicata per la lunghezza ($L$) e divisa per la sezione trasversale ($A$). Qui è una specie di strano animale che dipende da qualche parametro strutturale del portatore di carica e anche dalla concentrazione.

Ma non sto affermando di capirlo. Sto fondamentalmente dicendo: $I$ (densità di corrente) moltiplicata per la resistenza ($R_0$) è uguale a questa differenza ($V - E_{Nernst}$).

### 🔋 Circuito Equivalente: Serie, non Parallelo

Vi suona un campanello? Se vi ho detto che il problema iniziale era che avevo un resistore per il canale ionico e avevo una batteria... lasciatemi descrivere la batteria come un simbolo di un generatore di tensione ideale, o se volete con il segno della batteria che dimentico sempre quale è più e quale è meno...

Quindi potete provare, con le leggi di Kirchhoff, a vedere cosa succede se avete il resistore in **parallelo** con la membrana... con il generatore di tensione, o in **serie**.

[Immagine di circuito in serie: V(in) -> R -> E -> V(out)]
[Immagine di circuito in parallelo: V(in) -> R || E -> V(out)]

Questo sarà $V$, questo sarà $V$, e questa sarà la densità di corrente $I$.

Posso dirvi che questo [il parallelo] è sbagliato. E lo vedete immediatamente, perché qui sembra che la caduta di tensione, o la tensione attraverso questo canale ionico, sarà il potenziale di equilibrio di Nernst ($E$), il che potrebbe non essere il caso. Non è necessariamente quello che registriamo.

Questo [la serie], d'altra parte, sembra essere... per la legge delle tensioni di Kirchhoff... che dice, poiché il campo elettrico è un campo conservativo, il lavoro fatto dal campo non dipende dal percorso, dipende solo dal punto iniziale e finale. Quindi qui significa che devo descrivere tutti i...

Quindi questo sarà, chiamiamolo $E$ (il potenziale di Nernst). E qui ho la caduta di potenziale attraverso questo resistore. Chiamiamo questo resistore $R_0$. Questo è $R_0 \cdot I$, perché la corrente $I$ è ciò che è dato e, in effetti, è ciò che attraversa il resistore. Quindi prendo questa direzione e scriverei:
$E + R_0 \cdot I = V$ ... Scusate.

*(Applica la LKT alla maglia)*
$$-V + E + (R_0 \cdot I) = 0$$
$$V = E + R_0 \cdot I$$
$$V - E = R_0 \cdot I$$

E potete vedere molto chiaramente che se spostate questa quantità... *[errore nel parlato, l'equazione derivata $V-E=R_0 \cdot I$ corrisponde già a $I \cdot R_0 = V - E_{Nernst}$]* ...avete quell'equazione.

Quindi il modello, la descrizione di un canale ionico, è **questa qui**, dove avete un **resistore in serie con una batteria**. Non il parallelo.

Potete provare a vedere se... beh, in questo caso [parallelo], l'equazione sarebbe semplicemente $V = E$, che non è quello che vi aspettate. Non è quello che è scritto qui. Qui avete che $V$ meno il potenziale di Nernst è la corrente [per R].

### 🔄 Potenziale di Inversione (Reversal Potential)

Dico solo l'ultima cosa, e poi ci fermiamo per 10 minuti. Questo [potenziale di] Nernst è anche chiamato **potenziale di inversione** (*reversal potential*) perché se il potenziale intracellulare ($V$) è più grande o più piccolo del potenziale di Nernst ($E$), il **segno della corrente ($I$) si inverte**.


Ok, allora. Questo è il circuito equivalente della membrana attraverso un canale ionico. E ho cercato di farvi vedere, per chi di voi non è così fluente con l'elettrotecnica banale (che dovrebbe essere nel curriculum di molti di voi), perché automaticamente... perché automaticamente ha a che fare, richiama, la **serie** fra un resistore e un generatore di tensione, e non il parallelo.

Ho spiegato ai vostri colleghi poco fa che questa era un'altra possibilità teorica di come io, sapendo che da qualche parte c'è una batteria e sapendo che da qualche parte c'è un resistore, prima di arrivare qui... dove qui è un'equazione in cui la leggo e dico qual è il circuito equivalente... avrei potuto combinarli anche in modo parallelo.

L'ho detto prima dell'interruzione: il potenziale di Nernst viene chiamato non soltanto potenziale di equilibrio. Vi faccio presente e sottolineo che in questo caso **non si tratta di condizioni di equilibrio**. Infatti, c'è una corrente che prima era stata assunta essere zero (che è una densità di corrente). Si chiama anche **potenziale di inversione** perché vedete che se $V_{in}$ (il potenziale intracellulare) è maggiore o minore del potenziale di Nernst, la corrente cambia segno.

$$I = \frac{1}{R_0} (V_{in} - E_{Nernst})$$


In modo ancora più banale, se non doveste vederlo, potete scrivere l'equazione, rappresentare in modo grafico l'equazione in forma grafica. È un'equazione di una retta. Per cui vi rammento, $R_0$ era una costante, $E_{Nernst}$ pure è una costante nota. E nel piano corrente-tensione, o che lo scriviate come $I \cdot R = V$ oppure $I = G \cdot V$ (che è la forma che adotteremo, è semplicemente una convenzione), abbiamo che è una retta.



Come faccio a sapere che è orientata in questo modo? Io mi ricordo che quando... mi ricordo dal liceo, $y = m \cdot x$, quando $m$ era positiva nel piano $yx$ la retta era in quella direzione, era un coefficiente angolare positivo. In questo caso c'è un termine noto. Il termine noto non l'ho mai intuitivamente apprezzato se non quando mettevo la $x$ a 0, cioè quando il valore della coordinata indipendente, coordinata orizzontale, fosse 0, e allora quell'intersezione con gli assi era... *i*.

In questo caso vedete che io ottengo $I = 0$ (quindi è l'altra intersezione, con l'asse orizzontale, non con l'asse verticale) quando il secondo membro si annulla. Quando $V_{in}$ diventa uguale a $E_{Nernst}$, perché è l'unico modo, è l'unico valore che annulla, essendo $V$ la quantità incognita (gli altri ho detto sono parametri, numeri), è l'unico grado di libertà. $V_{in} = E_{Nernst} \implies I = 0$.

Quindi qui vedete che a questa intersezione ($V = E_{Nernst}$), la corrente prima è positiva (o negativa, a seconda della convenzione) e dopo è negativa (o positiva). Quindi viene anche chiamato **potenziale di inversione**.

Il fatto che io utilizzi il termine $G$ o $R$ è semplicemente che, quale che sia il valore numerico, io definisco uno o l'altro come $1$ diviso l'altro.

### 🏛️ La Legge di Kirchhoff e la Combinazione delle Correnti

Visto che dobbiamo a un certo punto invocare la legge della conservazione della corrente (ho parlato di Kirchhoff ai vostri colleghi), in cui dato un qualche circuito, avendo un nodo, voi sapete che posso identificare quello che viene chiamato un "cociclo", oppure una superficie chiusa che non intersechi la struttura dei singoli componenti. In questo caso, la somma algebrica delle correnti entranti e uscenti (vuol dire che devo stabilire una regola di chi entra, chi esce, se è positivo o se è negativo) è nulla, è zero. Vuol dire: **la carica non si distrugge**.

Allora, visto che avrò la corrente per il **sodio (Na$^+$)**, in cui avrò $G_0$ che è $G_{Na}$ (perché sono canali che sono permeabili al sodio), e avrò $E_{Nernst}$ del sodio (che era 56 millivolt, quello che era).
Poi avrò un'altra corrente che sarà per il **cloro (Cl⁻)**, in cui avrò $G$ che è del cloro (perché i canali sono altri canali, sono selettivi al passaggio di alcune specie ioniche, non a tutte), e avrò il potenziale di inversione del cloro.
E poi avrò la stessa cosa per il **potassio (K$^+$)**, per il **calcio (Ca²$^+$)**. Avrò tante correnti.

E vorrei a un certo punto, come in questo caso in cui... ok, è sbagliato farlo in questo circuito... ma nella membrana, avendo questo tipo di correnti attraverso la membrana, potrei dire che la membrana stessa si comporta come un cociclo e quindi che in qualche modo mi rappresenta la condizione: **somma delle correnti = 0**. Che è esattamente quello che faremo.

Per questo preferisco quella descrizione con la conduttanza ($G$), però è solamente un fatto di forma. È la legge di Ohm, che Ohm è quel signore nel riquadro. Quindi $G_0$, per esempio, è $1 / R_0$.

Mi sapete dire le unità di misura di... se questo [$R$] è **Ohm ($\Omega$)**, in onore di quel tizio, $G$ (le conduttanze) come si misurano? [Risposta implicita: Siemens (S)].

### 📉 Limiti dell'Approssimazione Ohmica e Rettificazione

Ci sono in realtà delle alternative, e ve ne presento una, perché l'approssimazione Ohmica non funziona tanto bene quando, in casi estremi... (questa è una descrizione matematica che ha un accordo perfetto o molto molto buono con l'esperimento)... quando il rapporto delle concentrazioni è molto estremo, molto piccolo oppure molto grande.

Nel caso del calcio, vi ho fatto presente che la concentrazione intracellulare è praticamente 0 ($10^{-2}$ millimolare), mentre fuori è dell'ordine di 10-20 millimolare, 5 millimolare... Nella corteccia, nel *medium* extracellulare dei neuroni corticali, è comunque di diversi millimoli, al contrario dell'intracellulare che è praticamente assente.

In quel caso, la relazione fra densità di corrente e potenziale **non è lineare**. Vedete che ha una forte **rettificazione**. Ogni traccia rappresenta un caso in cui il rapporto delle concentrazioni è indicato da questi *small numbers*: è 1000 volte uno e 1000 volte l'altro, oppure addirittura è 0.5 volte, 0.2 volte, 0.1 volte.

Vedete che non è una linea, ha un comportamento di rettificazione. Ma non evocherò alcun diodo, che in elettronica viene usato come termine di rettificazione. Vorrei capire se dal punto di vista biofisico riesco ad ottenere una descrizione più accurata, perché alla fine delle fini, se devo trovare un bilanciamento della corrente per arrivare a questo benedetto -70 millivolt... non vedo se la batteria è... *scala*.

Voglio avere un'espressione che mi possa descrivere: corrente = qualcosa.


### 📜 L'Equazione di Goldman (GHK)

Vi faccio vedere come si deriva, è molto importante per il suo uso in elettrofisiologia, in elettrofisiologia cellulare, in particolare in neuroscienze. Si chiama **equazione di Goldman** (o GHK: Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz) e ha una forma che è diversa, vedete che non è ohmica.

Il flusso ($J$), o la densità di corrente ($I$), ha una dipendenza dal potenziale (in questo caso ho solo scritto $V_{in}$, se volete scrivere $V_{in} - V_{out}$ dovete mettere anche qua, ma qui in questo caso [$V_{out}$] è stato preso convenzionalmente come zero).

$$J = P \cdot A \cdot V_{in} \frac{C_{out} - C_{in} \cdot e^{A \cdot V_{in}}}{1 - e^{A \cdot V_{in}}}$$

*$V_{in} - V_{out}$* qui è *$V_{in} - V_{out}$*... quindi è parente vagamente [della legge di Ohm], ma non è una relazione lineare.

Perdona, io avevo questo un tempo... Ok.

È parente, nel senso che contiene le concentrazioni all'esterno ($C_{out}$) e all'interno ($C_{in}$) della cellula. Questo $A$ è parente, se non mi ricordo male, adesso lo vediamo, dovrebbe essere l'inverso, $ZF/RT$. Comunque è un numero.

Quindi le dipendenze sono diverse, ma le quantità sono le stesse. Quindi funzionalmente questa descrizione è più accurata perché cattura questa rettificazione. Non la posso più rappresentare con degli equivalenti circuitali.

Come ha fatto Goldman a raggiungere questa nuova approssimazione? È un pelino meglio, come potete vedere, di quella ohmica. Che è sempre la rappresentazione ohmica... l'approssimazione ohmica è l'espansione in serie di Taylor arrestata al primo ordine, quindi sono parenti.

Infatti una cosa che vi chiedo è quella di provare, data questa funzione matematica di una variabile indipendente $V$, di scrivere Taylor. Spero che non sia una cosa drammatica, la possiamo poi eventualmente fare assieme. Troverete esattamente la stessa espressione ohmica che abbiamo derivato in un altro modo.

Quindi: non linearità, rettificazione, e permette di estendere il comportamento anche dove l'approssimazione ohmica non vale più (l'approssimazione ohmica essendo l'espansione in serie di Taylor). In particolare per il calcio non possiamo usare la formula ohmica, eppure... in teoria per capire come funzionano le cose.

Quindi **$A = ZF / RT$**, che è l'inverso di $RT / ZF$, che quindi è $1 / (25-26 \text{ mV})$ a temperatura ambiente per $Z = 1$, per la valenza unitaria.

E **$P$**, anche $P$ era importante, è un parametro chiamato **permeabilità**, che è parente della mobilità ($u$), chiaramente della temperatura ($T$), e in qualche modo ha una dipendenza dalla geometria della membrana ($\Delta x$, lo spessore).

$$P = \frac{u \cdot RT}{\Delta x}$$

E torna: se la membrana è molto piccola [sottile], la permeabilità è molto grande. La permeabilità della membrana a un certo ione non è più solamente un termine generico... *conversativo*, ma è una quantità misurabile. Se la temperatura è elevata, immaginate che ovviamente dal punto di vista diffusivo sia facile per uno ione magari attraversare la stessa membrana. E ovviamente deve dipendere linearmente, o comunque direttamente, dalla mobilità di quell'ione.

Però, vedete, ha una forma un po' più complicata, quindi non è una conduttanza elettrica in senso lato. Le conduttanze non dipendono dalla temperatura e dai parametri lineari in questo modo, dai parametri geometrici e dai parametri strutturali in questo modo. Questa è specifica per gli ioni ai capi di una membrana. E vedrete perché, quali sono le ipotesi che Goldman ha fatto.

Quindi il possibile esercizio è: provate a linearizzare (o che è la stessa cosa, a scrivere l'espansione in serie di Taylor al primo ordine) di questa espressione. Dovete calcolarla attorno al potenziale di inversione, al potenziale di Nernst. E qui non figura il potenziale di Nernst, quindi lo dovete mettere voi: $E_{Nernst} = (RT/ZF) \ln(C_{out}/C_{in})$. È un numero, però in qualche modo se lo fate vedrete che le quantità $R, T, Z, F, \text{etc.}$ si cancellano con... *varie*... come $P$ e $A$ sono definite.

L'unica cosa che richiede attenzione, di lavorare per un paio di minuti senza fare errori, è calcolare la **derivata prima rispetto a $V$** di questa funzione, che è il prodotto tra $V$ e quest'altro pezzo, che è un rapporto. Voi sapete come si fa la derivata di un prodotto o la derivata di un rapporto. E poi c'è il solito termine esponenziale e sapete come si deriva.

### 🧠 Derivazione dell'Equazione di Goldman

Come ha fatto questo Goldman a derivare questa equazione? È partito esattamente da dove siamo partiti noi, quindi la definizione di flussi: *drift* (deriva) e diffusione. I due termini. Non c'è alcuna ipotesi di equilibrio e adesso non faccio neppure l'ipotesi di approssimazione ohmica.

$$J = -uRT \frac{dC}{dx} - uCZF \frac{dV}{dx}$$

Per facilità chiamo $A$ questo $ZF/RT$ (o $RT/ZF$? *[Controlla] $A=ZF/RT$*). E questo è il pezzo che vi darà più fastidio: definisco io arbitrariamente questa funzione $H(x)$. Voi dite: "Come ha fatto?" È perché questo era un genio che ha visto un modo per semplificare questa espressione, perché alla fine queste derivate, questi esponenziali... alla fine dicono più o meno la stessa cosa a un matematico che ha l'occhio fine.

Quindi, supponete di staccare il cervello per un attimo e dire: ok, questa è una nuova funzione che non ha alcuna relazione con la biofisica, la definisco io così:

$$H(x) = uRT \cdot C(x) \cdot e^{A \cdot V(x)}$$

Nota: sto pensando che $V$ possa essere una funzione del punto dentro la membrana, in teoria.

Ricordo, magari me lo dite voi, che se uno ha un condensatore a facce piane parallele, quindi non tanto teoria dei circuiti ma elettromagnetismo, sa che qui dentro, per questo particolare accorgimento, per questa particolare geometria, il campo elettrico ($E$) qui dentro, quindi nel dielettrico (nella membrana), com'è? Com'è il campo elettrico? **Costante**.

È una cosa molto importante. Se il campo elettrico è costante, il potenziale vuol dire che varia **linearmente**. E non ci vuole una particolare scienza, perché se qui supponete siete a massa, questo è 0 millivolt, e qui siete, che ne so, il condensatore carico, vedete che ha 5 volt... da 0 a 5 qualcosa deve succedere all'interno del dielettrico. Avete tante ipotesi: potrebbe essere una discontinuità di prima specie, potrebbe essere un profilo sinusoidale... Quello che nell'ipotesi, e poi nel caso specifico di un condensatore a facce piane parallele infinito, è ovviamente un potenziale che rispecchia il campo elettrico costante. Il campo elettrico costante è il gradiente del potenziale ($E = -dV/dx$). Per avere un campo elettrico costante (una costante), dovete avere qualcosa che... *viene* costante. Vuol dire che il gradiente deve essere di una quantità che varia linearmente con $x$, così quando fate la derivata non avete più la dipendenza da $x$, avete una cosa costante. Però lo vediamo.

Data questa quantità $H(x)$, provo a vedere che succede se faccio la **derivata rispetto a $x$** ($dH/dx$). Perché vedete che facendo la derivata rispetto a $x$ ci somiglia parecchio a questo flusso ($J$).

Questa cosa qua [il flusso $J$] viene dalla biofisica. Qui è puramente matematico che, scrivendo le cose così, una funzione che è sia della concentrazione ($C$) sia del potenziale ($V$), a un certo punto facendo la derivata... per esempio, a un certo punto qui sarà la derivata di un prodotto. Adesso lo guardiamo assieme. Anzi, guardiamolo subito assieme.

$uRT$ è una costante. La derivata di una costante per qualcosa è la costante (la linearità), la costante che moltiplica la derivata di quel qualcosa. Il "qualcosa" è un prodotto fra funzioni ($C \cdot e^{AV}$). La derivata di un prodotto, vi ricordate, è: (derivata del primo) $\times$ (secondo) + (derivata del secondo) $\times$ (primo), se l'ho detta giusta.

$$\frac{dH}{dx} = uRT \left[ \frac{dC}{dx} \cdot e^{AV} + C \cdot \frac{d(e^{AV})}{dx} \right]$$

Quindi qui avete che ho fatto la derivata del primo, $dC/dx$. Non lo so qual è $C$, qual è la forma, quindi lo lascio indicato nel caso generico, perché $C$ può avere un profilo di concentrazione arbitrario. $C$ può essere... anziché imporre una diversa distribuzione di concentrazioni dentro o fuori, potrei imporre una tensione dall'esterno con una batteria e lì avrei una ridistribuzione di carica e un cambiamento delle concentrazioni. Quindi in teoria vorrei avere come prima qualcosa che sia autoconsistente. Io a mio piacimento dico: "adesso l'incognita è una", "adesso l'incognita è l'altra".

L'altro pezzo è la (derivata del secondo) $\times$ (primo). Quindi il primo era $C$, per la derivata di questa funzione composta ($e^{AV(x)}$), che però è l'esponenziale... è simpatico perché resta la stessa derivata, a parte fare la derivata dell'argomento ($A \cdot V(x)$). E quindi c'è una $A$ che è rimasta qui, questo è l'esponenziale che è sopravvissuto, e poi c'è la derivata di questo pezzo, $dV/dx$.

$$\frac{dH}{dx} = uRT \left[ \frac{dC}{dx} \cdot e^{AV} + C \cdot e^{AV} \cdot A \cdot \frac{dV}{dx} \right]$$

Vedete che $dV/dx$ c'era anche qui [nel flusso $J$]. Qui c'è una derivata... ok, qui è la derivata del logaritmo... qui c'è una derivata... insomma, non è troppo diverso.

E lo posso anche provare a riscrivere in questo modo, fattorizzando questa... *concentrazione*... questo termine qui ($e^{AV}$). Oppure, se siete pignoli, vuol dire che ho moltiplicato e diviso questa quantità ($dC/dx$) per $C$. Lo posso fare perché la quantità [$C$] è non nulla e mi permette di portare fuori la $C$, questa $C$, che adesso premoltiplica sia questo che questo termine. Però, ovviamente, qui la pago: è $1/C$.

$$\frac{dH}{dx} = uRT \cdot C \cdot e^{AV} \left[ \frac{1}{C} \frac{dC}{dx} + A \cdot \frac{dV}{dx} \right]$$

$1/C$ per la derivata di $C$... forse vi ricorda che forse si può scrivere come la **derivata del logaritmo** ($\frac{d(\ln C)}{dx}$). La derivata del logaritmo è esattamente... *quanto vogliamo qui*. Quindi questo Goldman è stato molto lungimirante, perché vi faccio vedere che fra poco abbiamo praticamente l'espressione del flusso.

$$\frac{dH}{dx} = uRT \cdot C \cdot e^{AV} \left[ \frac{d(\ln C)}{dx} + A \cdot \frac{dV}{dx} \right]$$

Non vuol dire niente per il momento, è una similitudine, ma "massaggiando" e lavorando su quest'altra equazione differenziale, posso ottenere più facilmente, molto facilmente, una nuova espressione che mi metta in relazione il flusso ($J$), la concentrazione ($C$) e il potenziale ($V$).

Faccio ancora un... quindi qui non è cambiato nulla, scusate... ho fattorizzato anche l'esponenziale $e^{AV}$. E quindi qui ho la derivata del logaritmo e qui ho la derivata di $V$.

A parte questo $uRT$... e $ZF$... perché $A$ è $ZF/RT$. Quindi qui forse non vi darà troppo fastidio se io di nuovo moltiplico e divido per $RT$ e poi lo fattorizzo, in modo tale che qui al denominatore ho di nuovo $RT$. Quindi quel termine ($A$), a parte che si chiama $A$, di $1 / (26 \text{ mV})$, lo riscopro, ma diventa una similitudine con la parte fra parentesi notevole.

*(Ricordando l'espressione del flusso J e $A = ZF/RT$)*
$$J = -uRT \frac{dC}{dx} - uCZF \frac{dV}{dx}$$
$$J = -uRT \left( \frac{dC}{dx} + C \frac{ZF}{RT} \frac{dV}{dx} \right)$$
$$J = -uRT \left( \frac{dC}{dx} + C \cdot A \cdot \frac{dV}{dx} \right)$$
*(Confrontando con $dH/dx$)*
$$\frac{dH}{dx} = uRT \cdot e^{AV} \left[ \frac{dC}{dx} + C \cdot A \cdot \frac{dV}{dx} \right]$$
*(O c'è un errore nella trascrizione originale o nella derivazione parlata, perché $d(\ln C)/dx$ non porta direttamente a $dC/dx$. Assumendo che la fattorizzazione corretta fosse $uRT \cdot e^{AV}$ dall'espressione precedente...)*

$$\frac{dH}{dx} = e^{AV} \left[ uRT \frac{dC}{dx} + uRT \cdot C \cdot A \cdot \frac{dV}{dx} \right]$$
$$\frac{dH}{dx} = e^{AV} \left[ uRT \frac{dC}{dx} + uRT \cdot C \cdot \frac{ZF}{RT} \cdot \frac{dV}{dx} \right]$$
$$\frac{dH}{dx} = e^{AV} \left[ uRT \frac{dC}{dx} + uCZF \frac{dV}{dx} \right]$$
$$\frac{dH}{dx} = -e^{AV} \cdot J$$

Ed è qui, è rappresentata qui. *[La trascrizione sembra saltare dei passaggi algebrici, ma arriva alla relazione cruciale]*.

Qui c'è la concentrazione... qui c'è anche la concentrazione. Se lo fate una volta carta e penna lo vedrete.

Quindi posso anche scrivere, vedete quanto è simile e quanto è geniale, che la derivata di questa funzione "del piffero" ($H(x)$) — che io onestamente non l'avrei vista, non avrei saputo — è praticamente il flusso ($J$), a parte il segno e il prodotto per questo esponenziale.

$$\frac{dH}{dx} = -J \cdot e^{A \cdot V(x)}$$

La domanda è: ma se io applico l'integrale da ambo i membri, qui e qui, non è che me la cavo? E la risposta è sì, me la cavo meglio.

Ho riscritto la quantità là sopra. Applico l'integrale ai capi della membrana ($x_{in}$ a $x_{out}$).
Questo [$dH/dx$] è un differenziale perfetto.
Questo [lato destro], devo fare delle ipotesi.

$$\int_{x_{in}}^{x_{out}} \frac{dH}{dx} dx = \int_{x_{in}}^{x_{out}} -J \cdot e^{A \cdot V(x)} dx$$
$$H(x_{out}) - H(x_{in}) = -J \int_{x_{in}}^{x_{out}} e^{A \cdot V(x)} dx$$

Le ipotesi sono:
1.  Come prima, che il **flusso ($J$) non dipenda dal punto** dentro un canale. Di nuovo, questa non è un'approssimazione troppo irrealistica perché penso che il canale ionico non abbia una "pancia" che si deforma... come se uno ha il *beer belly* per cui la birra a un certo punto si accumula e poi... un paragone che non è elegante, come d'altronde leccare il proprio sudore non era elegante in primo luogo. Però, quindi, immaginando che è una proteina che crea uno spazietto attraverso la membrana nel doppio strato fosfolipidico e permette agli ioni di passare, penso (come alcune simulazioni di dinamica molecolare hanno rivelato) è più simile a una specie di contagocce, dove le singole gocce sono gli ioni. Quindi il flusso non può cambiare granché, c'è una specie di conservazione, in punti diversi il flusso è lo stesso, non c'è un accumulo, non c'è una specie di "tasca" (ecco la parola) che permette l'accumulo di ioni.
2.  Resto con un integrale di una quantità $e^{A \cdot V(x)}$. $A$ è un numero, è $1 / (26 \text{ mV})$. E qui l'unica cosa che posso fare, visto che il dominio di integrazione è all'interno della membrana (da qui a qui), è quello di dire: se è veramente un condensatore a facce piane parallele, allora il **potenziale ($V$) rappresentato come un cambiamento lineare** è un'approssimazione perfetta.

Le cose non stanno esattamente così, perché la membrana non è solamente un doppio strato lipidico, c'è un sacco di altre molecole dentro, cariche (perché voi sapete che le macromolecole biologiche, dipende dal pH qual è la loro carica), quindi non è così sempre, non è detto che il potenziale dipenda linearmente dalla coordinata *verticale*. E un'altra ragione per cui questo potrebbe non essere vero è perché i canali ionici non sono dei tubicini, non sono dei pori, sono dei complicati *arrangement*, quindi complicate disposizioni tridimensionali di amminoacidi che hanno una distribuzione di carica, quindi non sono neutri. Hanno alcuni punti del canale ionico che sono carichi. Ed è proprio quello il motivo per cui hanno, per esempio, una selettività, per cui fanno passare uno ione potassio anziché uno ione sodio. Quindi non è esattamente un dielettrico, perché ci sono delle cariche libere dentro. Comunque, questo è semplicemente per darvi elementi di biofisica.

Se mi sta bene che $J$ non dipenda dal punto (che va bene) e che il campo elettrico sia costante (quindi $V$ cambi linearmente), quindi sia una quantità... adesso l'ho scritta così ($V(x) = M \cdot x + P$), però spero che voi possiate aiutarmi a scrivere $M$ e $P$ in funzione di quelli che sono i valori all'estremità del condensatore. In un caso è 0 (o $V_{out}$), l'altro caso è $V_{in}$. Sto invocando quello che avrete visto: è l'equazione di una retta che passa per due punti. Scusate, no, ecco... c'è la retta che passa per un punto, dove il punto lo specifico con le coordinate. Non me lo ricordo, adesso lo vediamo.

Ok, ho scritto qui l'espressione lineare, così che chi di voi sia particolarmente insospettito dall'integrale di una quantità che dipende da una funzione, possa vedere che qui è l'esponenziale di una somma, che è il prodotto degli esponenziali.

$$e^{A \cdot V(x)} = e^{A \cdot (M \cdot x + P)} = e^{A \cdot M \cdot x} \cdot e^{A \cdot P}$$

Quindi il primo termine è $e^{A \cdot M \cdot x}$, che è il solito esponenziale *boring* di cui io so tutto e so fare l'integrale, perché l'ho spogliato di qualunque complessità. Questo esponenziale moltiplica un altro esponenziale che è $e^{A \cdot P}$, però è un numero, non c'è più $x$, non c'è più la variabile di integrazione.

Quindi la primitiva dell'argomento di questo integrale è molto facile:
$$\int e^{A \cdot M \cdot x} \cdot e^{A \cdot P} dx = e^{A \cdot P} \cdot \frac{1}{A \cdot M} e^{A \cdot M \cdot x} = \frac{1}{A \cdot M} e^{A \cdot (M \cdot x + P)}$$

E per il teorema fondamentale del calcolo integrale, lo calcolo in $x_{out}$ meno lo calcolo in $x_{in}$. Ho fatto la stessa cosa a sinistra, ma lì era un differenziale perfetto ($H(x_{out}) - H(x_{in})$).

Quello che ho dovuto fare era ricordarmi che, sì, a parte dividere per $A \cdot M$, quando fate la derivata per tornare indietro per verificare che quella sia la funzione primitiva, si cancelli. Perché se io faccio la derivata di $e^{A \cdot M \cdot x + P}$, qui mi viene fuori $A \cdot M$ come prodotto, quindi lo devo cancellare. Comunque, se provate a farlo, lo vedrete.

E, quindi, perché sto dicendo "se l'espressione della retta che passa per due punti"? Dicendo che questo è $x$, qui ho $x_{in}$, qui ho $x_{out}$, qui è $V_{out}$... ok sì, sono due punti, perché sono rimbambito. E quindi qui è $(x_{in}, V_{in})$ e qui è $(x_{out}, V_{out})$.

Se non ve la ricordate, potete pensare che debba essere qualcosa che agli estremi... quindi muovendo una delle due variabili, che potete fare con la variabile indipendente $x$ per esempio, vi porta al valore della variabile dipendente. Quindi, tanto per intenderci:
$$V(x) = V_{in} + (V_{out} - V_{in}) \frac{x - x_{in}}{x_{out} - x_{in}}$$
Quando $x = x_{in}$, questo termine si cancella perché il numeratore è 0, quindi va a 0 tutto, e in effetti a $x = x_{in}$, $V = V_{in}$.
Mentre quando $x = x_{out}$, questo termine diventa unitario perché c'è questo termine di normalizzazione al denominatore, sopravvive $(V_{out} - V_{in}) + V_{in}$ e quindi si cancella $V_{in}$, resta $V_{out}$. Oppure invocate o guardate l'espressione della retta che passa per due punti.

Quello è il coefficiente angolare ($M = (V_{out} - V_{in}) / (x_{out} - x_{in})$). Lo posso sostituire e posso ottenere questa espressione, e ancora questa. Praticamente abbiamo finito. Posso rimaneggiare leggermente per identificare la famosa permeabilità $P$.

No, perdono, non ho finito. Adesso che ho qui la differenza di questa funzione apparentemente complicata, discesa dall'arcangelo Gabriele che l'ha data a Goldman per semplificargli la vita, posso calcolarla dove è indicato qui: in $x_{out}$, meno la stessa funzione calcolata in $x_{in}$.

$$H(x_{out}) - H(x_{in}) = uRT \cdot C_{out} \cdot e^{A \cdot V_{out}} - uRT \cdot C_{in} \cdot e^{A \cdot V_{in}}$$

Ed è facile, perché quando $V$ lo calcolo in $x_{in}$ o in $x_{out}$ ottengo per definizione il potenziale agli estremi.

Qui non ho fatto nulla, è esattamente la stessa cosa.
$$uRT (C_{out} e^{A V_{out}} - C_{in} e^{A V_{in}}) = -J \left[ \frac{1}{A \cdot M} e^{A \cdot V(x)} \right]_{x_{in}}^{x_{out}}$$
*(Sostituendo M e $\Delta x = x_{out} - x_{in}$)*
$$... = -J \frac{\Delta x}{A(V_{out}-V_{in})} (e^{A V_{out}} - e^{A V_{in}})$$

E posso rendere esplicito $J$ dividendo ambo i membri per questa quantità [l'integrale calcolato].

$$J = -uRT \frac{A(V_{out}-V_{in})}{\Delta x} \frac{C_{out} e^{A V_{out}} - C_{in} e^{A V_{in}}}{e^{A V_{out}} - e^{A V_{in}}}$$

Qui vedete che questa differenza di esponenziali, che prima era qui al numeratore, adesso l'ho portata al denominatore dall'altro lato. Lo provate a fare per 10 minuti e dovreste vedere che è noioso, ma che inizia a contenere tutti gli elementi che c'erano nell'espressione di Goldman, che poi è questa.

Si può massaggiare ancora, fattorizzando $e^{A \cdot V_{out}}$ perché questa quantità la posso portare fuori. Ovviamente devo moltiplicare e dividere per $e^{A \cdot V_{out}}$, ma gli esponenziali quando si moltiplicano o dividono vuol dire fare delle operazioni di, rispettivamente, somma o differenza dei loro argomenti, dei loro esponenti.

Quindi potete arrivare a scrivere $1$ meno... in quel caso era $C_{out}$ meno... in cui l'esponenziale non ce l'avete da entrambe le parti, ce l'avete da una parte sola, e qui avete l'esponenziale della differenza, perché era il rapporto degli esponenziali avendo fatto questa fattorizzazione sia al numeratore che al denominatore.

*(Assumendo $V_{out}=0$, $V_{in}=V$ e $A=ZF/RT$)*
$$J = -uRT \frac{A \cdot V}{\Delta x} \frac{C_{out} - C_{in} e^{A V}}{1 - e^{A V}}$$
*(Definendo la Permeabilità $P = uRT / \Delta x$)*
$$J = -P \cdot A \cdot V \frac{C_{out} - C_{in} e^{A V}}{1 - e^{A V}}$$

Questa è la versione più stringata possibile. Non è particolarmente più complicata. Adesso vi faccio vedere come si può per esempio plottare, vi faccio vedere l'esempio di un *notebook* che avete sul repository di GitHub, e in teoria potreste giocare, potreste esplorare quanto si discosta dall'approssimazione lineare... pardon, ohmica.

E qui ora per il momento potete verificare che $uRT / (x_{out} - x_{in})$ conviene descriverlo a parte come **permeabilità ($P$)**. Questo è interessante perché diverse conduttanze ioniche avranno una diversa permeabilità, quindi alcuni canali ionici potrebbero avere una diversa propensione a far passare quella specie. Alcune sono semplici... non parlo solamente di selettività, ma anche di conduttanza. Magari le conduttanze sodio sono molto più grandi di quelle potassio. In teoria questo dà una chiave per misurare dal punto di vista biofisico.


### 💡 Combinare Diversi Ioni: L'Equazione GHK

Vi anticipo che, a parte menzionarvi l'uso di questa forma, di questa equazione di Goldman, preferisco usare l'**espressione ohmica** delle correnti (di come il flusso o la densità di corrente dipende dal potenziale), perché ho in testa Kirchhoff, la legge delle correnti. E a un certo punto vorrei mettere insieme questi ioni. Vi ho detto: -70 [mV] evidentemente esce dal mettere e combinare assieme, non in una media aritmetica ma in qualche modo, i contributi dovuti a ioni diversi. Con Kirchhoff, intuitivamente, mi dà una speranza che posso immaginare che valga la conservazione della carica.

Qui [con Goldman] posso tranquillamente farlo, ma mi troverò a fare una sommatoria, una somma di questi termini. Non mi è evidente come fattorizzare questi elementi, ma vedrete perché ho queste preferenze.

Ok, questo doveva apparire prima, ma questa è l'equazione di Goldman. Se io ve la dovessi chiedere all'orale, non vuol dire che io sto zitto; vi aiuto se avete delle incertezze e a fare i passi, che può essere che vi interrompa prima di arrivare fino in fondo. Quindi tecnicamente dovete solo partire, avere in mente le ipotesi e partire dalle definizioni del flusso. E ovviamente ricordarvi questa funzione [$H(x)$], però $uRT$, oramai ne avete la nausea, avete la concentrazione e il potenziale. $e^{AV}$ ricorda... ok, no, voi non... ok, niente. Quindi questo dovete ricordare, ma se non ve lo ricordate ve lo dico io all'esame. Quindi non temete troppo, al di là del fatto che vi ho già raccontato la prima lezione quale sia la media e il voto tipico che ho dato ai vostri colleghi del primo anno. Non vi ammazzo all'orale, tanto per intenderci. Mi accorgo se avete un'ottima memoria fotografica e se state riproducendo perfettamente le slide o quello che ho scritto alla lavagna. Io vorrei che vi restasse qualcosa, vorrei che l'aveste capito. Qui è una macchinetta che mettete in modo puramente di derivate, ma in generale valuto meglio l'aspetto di comprensione e di derivazione piuttosto che l'aspetto mnemonico.

Questo non lo faccio, però vi invito a provarci. Si mostra che facendo la derivata [l'espansione di Taylor] trovate praticamente l'equazione, la formulazione ohmica. E vi esce fuori Nernst, esce fuori continuamente.


### 🎯 Il Potenziale di Membrana a Riposo (GHK)

E adesso togliamo tutte le ipotesi, tutte le restrizioni che abbiamo fatto. Quindi:
1.  Non considero l'equilibrio.
2.  Considero (cosa che non ho fatto finora) **più specie ioniche simultaneamente**.

Quello che mi porterà è alla caratterizzazione, alla comprensione dell'esistenza del potenziale di membrana a riposo, con quella che si chiama l'equazione di **Goldman, Hodgkin e Katz (GHK)**.

Forse avete mai sentito parlare di Hodgkin e Huxley? Nella prima puntata vi ho raccontato chi erano e, nonostante fossero dei fisiologi, hanno un'equazione a loro intitolata.

Qui adotto, per varie specie ioniche (che per semplicità qui, per non scrivere Na, K, Ca, magnesio, cloro, sto usando un pedice $k$), dove $k$ è 1, 2, 3... è un indice con cui chiamo le specie ioniche. E di nuovo, qui sto semplicemente scrivendo che, data una membrana, esistono dei flussi, delle densità di corrente per ciascuna specie ionica, di cui so tutto. In teoria l'avrei potuto scrivere con un'altra espressione, con quella di Goldman, e lo faccio dopo. Ma qui lo voglio fare soltanto con l'**equazione ohmica**.

$$I_k = G_k \cdot (V - E_k)$$

Ciascuno avrà la sua conduttanza ($G_k$), ciascuno avrà il suo potenziale di equilibrio o potenziale di inversione di Nernst ($E_k$). Chiamatelo come volete. Ho chiamato conduttanza l'inverso della resistenza. Chiamatelo come volete, è qualcosa che non solo c'è, ma si può facilmente misurare. Misurare vuol dire misurare in un esperimento con un amplificatore, con un amplificatore elettronico, un esperimento biologico.

E quindi sto pensando che la membrana sia caratterizzata da pori, ciascuno dei quali è in realtà una **serie** fra una batteria (un generatore di tensione ideale) e una resistenza.



Nota: queste resistenze, o questi generatori, sono ovviamente, al contrario del caso elettrico, permeabili a specie ioniche diverse. Mentre quando io lo scrivo così, il circuito elettrico, lì è un elettrone, può passare in qualunque ramo. Però questo va bene per derivare quello a cui siamo interessati: di capire perché c'è questo dannato **-70 millivolt** o come esce fuori.

In particolare, se questo cambia nel tempo, che cosa qui può cambiare così rapidamente nel tempo?

Quindi ho messo quei rami attraverso la membrana perché spero che intuitivamente anche voi vi immaginiate la superficie di un palloncino con questi pori. E questi pori in qualche modo sperimentano, per questo ramo interno (intracellulare), lo stesso potenziale intracellulare. Non ne abbiamo parlato particolarmente, ma il potenziale intracellulare, visto che non è un conduttore ideale... però comunque posso considerare il potenziale elettrico intracellulare come $V_{in}$, isopotenziale. Anzi, ne abbiamo parlato la settimana scorsa quando vi ho fatto vedere che facevo sparire le resistenze che erano all'interno e all'esterno, immaginando cioè che fosse più difficoltoso per uno ione diffondere o passare attraverso la membrana piuttosto che muoversi in un elettrolita (in un conduttore ideale), piuttosto che attraverso una membrana che di per sé è un isolante e ha delle strutture.

Quindi, a rigore, dovrei metterci anche il condensatore qua. Però il condensatore ce lo mettiamo fra poco. Però vorrei farvi notare che tutti questi [canali] stanno sperimentando lo stesso $V_{in}$ e lo stesso $V_{out}$ ai loro estremi. Però ognuno ha la sua conduttanza ($G_k$) e il suo potenziale di inversione ($E_k$).

Quindi il circuito a cui finalmente voglio applicare Kirchhoff ce l'ho. Il nodo in particolare, qui, a cui voglio applicare Kirchhoff ce l'ho, ed è questo nodo qui [il nodo intracellulare]. Dove io dico, oppure se non vi piace il nodo, semplicemente posso dire che la corrente... e poi è una conseguenza... la somma algebrica delle correnti è zero, o la carica (e vi ricordo che la corrente è carica nell'unità di tempo, quindi le due cose sono intercambiabili) si conserva.

Quindi, se io rappresento la corrente totale ($I_{tot}$), la posso scrivere come la sovrapposizione degli effetti. Ma non sto facendo ipotesi particolarmente strambe, sto trasferendo in termini matematici quello che è il **parallelo** di queste correnti. Vanno tutte in parallelo. I canali ionici, tutti quanti, sperimentano la stessa differenza di potenziale fra la loro "testa" e la loro "coda", fra la bocca extracellulare e la bocca intracellulare.

$$I_{tot} = \sum_k I_k = \sum_k G_k (V - E_k)$$

Quindi qui è la stessa $V$ ($V_{in}$, $V_{out}$ è zero). Però ognuno ha una conduttanza (una resistenza) diversa e una batteria in serie diversa.


### ⚖️ Il Potenziale di Riposo come Media Pesata

Però, se io a un certo punto vi dico: "Sono in una condizione di riposo" (se volete, di non-equilibrio termodinamico, in cui le singole correnti sono zero perché sono morto, e quindi non c'è più alcun passaggio né di sodio né di potassio), "ma la somma degli effetti, in media, statisticamente, il totale è zero"... Voi algebricamente dite: "Ok, sì, questo è Kirchhoff".

$$I_{tot} = \sum_k G_k (V - E_k) = 0$$

Questa corrente totale... a meno che non ci sia io con una pipetta, qui, a imporre una pipetta di vetro, a metterci dentro una corrente che decido io... se non c'è questa pipetta, se la pipetta legge solo, registra soltanto il potenziale, voi dite: "Ok, metti questa quantità a zero e andiamo a casa. Perché ci rompi le scatole da tre settimane su questa cosa del -70... due settimane forse?". Ed è esattamente quello che avviene.

Se lo faccio, posso prima, se volete per semplicità, fattorizzare $V$. E quindi vedete che è $G_1 \cdot V + G_2 \cdot V + G_3 \cdot V$... a parte $G_1 \cdot E_1, G_2 \cdot E_2, G_3 \cdot E_3$.

$$0 = (G_1 \cdot V + G_2 \cdot V + \dots) - (G_1 \cdot E_1 + G_2 \cdot E_2 + \dots)$$
$$0 = V \cdot \sum_k G_k - \sum_k G_k E_k$$

Però sia $G$ che $E$ sono costanti, sono numeri. Uno è -80 millivolt, l'altro è -62, quello del sodio è +56 millivolt, quello del calcio era +120... sono numeri. E anche le conduttanze sono dei numeri.

Quello che è interessante è che questa parte qui [$V$] premoltiplica la somma delle conduttanze ($\sum G_k$). E ok, torna con l'elettrotecnica, perché il parallelo delle resistenze... l'ho cancellato qui. Questo è un parallelo delle conduttanze, la conduttanza si somma. La resistenza è $1$ diviso la somma degli $1$ diviso... *degli inversi*... l'inverso è la somma degli inversi.

Quindi, fatto così, se io qui lo metto a zero (perché sto dicendo: ok, in condizioni di riposo, dove "riposo" vuol dire che il flusso netto è zero, quindi non i singoli flussi, che vorrebbe dire che sono morto, ma il totale è zero), voi mi dite: "Ok, porto questa quantità orribile [$\sum G_k E_k$] al primo membro... scusate, al membro di sinistra, e divido ambo i membri per questo $G_1 + G_2...$, per la sommatoria delle conduttanze".

$$V \cdot \sum_k G_k = \sum_k G_k E_k$$
$$V_{\text{rest}} = \frac{\sum_k G_k E_k}{\sum_k G_k}$$

Se lo faccio, scopro che il **potenziale di riposo ($V_{\text{rest}}$)** non è la media *algebrica*... non è la media *aritmetica* dei singoli componenti. È la **media pesata**.

E di nuovo, a posteriori, sembra un'ovvietà. Se ho diversi canali, diverse porte, però sono specifiche (quindi solamente tra di voi gli ioni sodio passano da un lato, gli ioni potassio passano da un lato)... in questo modo, avendo dei potenziali di inversione diversi (per il sodio è +56, per il potassio era -80, era negativo per la storia del logaritmo che è ancora lì), posso immaginare che dipenda se le porte sono aperte o sono chiuse.

Posso immaginare che il potenziale di riposo dipenda da quanto sono questi "pesi" ($G_1$ rispetto a $G_2$). Supponete che non ci siano gli altri: se $G_1$ è grandissimo e $G_2$ è 0, $G_1$ e $G_1$ si semplifica, $V_{\text{rest}}$ diventerebbe uguale a $E_1$. Mentre se per caso $G_1$ fosse invece piccolo (magari la porta è stata chiusa, oppure perché la porta è molto stretta), $V_{\text{rest}}$ sarebbe più pesato... è pesato di più da un altro potenziale di inversione, un altro potenziale di equilibrio.

Tutto questo per cercare di darvi una comprensione profonda e intuitiva di questa parte, in cui il risultato è molto semplice: è la media pesata, e le conduttanze giocano la parte principale.

E in effetti, se io questo a un certo punto... come faremo credo nelle prossime ore, iniziamo la parte sull'eccitabilità... Potrei dire: "Ma se io questo non lo vedo stare a -70? Se da un momento all'altro questo schizza a +20 millivolt e poi ritorna e va a -90 millivolt e poi ritorna a -70... Come caspita è possibile?"

È vero che per il momento non sto considerando i termini capacitivi. Gli elettronici fra di voi direbbero: "Sì, stai considerando solamente le cosiddette correnti di trasporto, in cui c'è fisicamente un trasporto da dentro a fuori. Non sto considerando le correnti di spostamento, che sono fenomeni elettrostatici per cui se io col mio carisma elettrico mi avvicino qua, sicuramente un sacco di gente viene attratto dall'altra parte della 'porta' del condensatore". Però li mettiamo fra poco.


### 🧮 L'Equazione GHK (Versione Permeabilità)

Quello che storicamente è stato fatto — quindi questa equazione è quella che viene chiamata equazione di **Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK)**, con le conduttanze per ovvi motivi — si può fare con la formulazione di Goldman.

Perché (e adesso vedete come), se mi consentite la semplificazione che considero tutti correnti relativi a ioni con la **stessa valenza** (se le valenze sono diverse non viene così semplice l'espressione, la potete fare numericamente ma non viene così semplice), posso prendere questi flussi [dall'equazione di Goldman] e dire $J_1$ (che è del sodio) + $J_2$ (del potassio) + $J_3$ + $J_4$... tutti uguali a zero.

$$J_{tot} = \sum_k J_k = 0$$

Sicuramente non è immediato, vediamo cosa succede.

Quindi questi sono tutti i termini [dell'equazione di Goldman per ogni ione $k$], dove semplicemente ho messo un pedice $k$ addove le cose sono diverse.

$$J_k = -P_k \cdot A \cdot V \frac{C_{out,k} - C_{in,k} e^{A V}}{1 - e^{A V}}$$

Sono diverse nella **permeabilità ($P_k$)**, non certamente in $V_{in}$ e $V_{out}$ (perché come nell'altro caso, di nuovo, i canali sperimentano lo stesso $V_{in}$ e $V_{out}$), e l'ho messo il pedice $k$ (o 2 o 1, quello che è) alle **concentrazioni ($C_{out,k}$ e $C_{in,k}$)**, perché quelle dipendono se sei sodio, se sei potassio (dentro c'è poco sodio, fuori c'è tanto sodio; se sei potassio è viceversa, dentro c'è tanto potassio e fuori c'è poco potassio).

Posso fattorizzare il termine comune $A \cdot V / (1 - e^{AV})$.

$$J_{tot} = -A \cdot V \frac{1}{1 - e^{A V}} \sum_k P_k (C_{out,k} - C_{in,k} e^{A V}) = 0$$

Già di default questo termine [$A \cdot V$] e questo termine [$1 - e^{AV}$] non dipendono dal pedice. E qui ottengo una cosa che è un pochino fastidiosa, perché ho la somma di questi binomi: $(P_k C_{out,k} - P_k C_{in,k} \cdot e^{AV})$. L'esponenziale [$e^{AV}$] l'ho potuto... *[errore nel parlato, $e^{AV}$ è dentro la sommatoria]*... No, non posso.
Ho dovuto spezzare la sommatoria. E non è una brutta idea, perché vi faccio vedere cosa si riesce a scrivere adesso.

$$\sum_k P_k C_{out,k} - \sum_k P_k C_{in,k} e^{A V} = 0$$
$$\sum_k P_k C_{out,k} - e^{A V} \sum_k P_k C_{in,k} = 0$$

Quindi, quando dico che il flusso totale è zero, per lo stesso motivo di Kirchhoff (in cui sto dicendo di nuovo: è un equilibrio dinamico, non è la "morte termodinamica" in cui i singoli flussi sono a zero, ma... *la morte*... è un equilibrio dinamico, il totale, la loro somma degli effetti è mediamente nulla), mi accorgo che qui ci sono due casi per far venire questo flusso totale zero.
Vuol dire che:
1.  O il potenziale intracellulare ($V$) è nullo. È ok, è un caso legittimo, ma non mi interessa perché sperimentalmente io non lo vedo nullo, non lo vedo zero. Vedo che c'è una caduta di potenziale ai capi della membrana, che è quello che vorrei capire.
2.  Questo al denominatore non conta. Questo termine [il numeratore] può essere zero, essendo un prodotto di termini, solo se il primo [$-A \cdot V / (1 - e^{AV})$] o il secondo [la sommatoria] sono 0. Il primo... ok, [$V=0$] non mi interessa il caso semplice.
3.  O il caso che questa quantità [la sommatoria] sia 0. Ed è un pochino... mi intimidisce, perché apparentemente... *non è un bordello*, però è grande, è complicato, non mi piace.

La somma di termini vuol dire che questa differenza è 0. Cioè vuol dire che questa somma qui [$\sum P_k C_{out,k}$] è uguale a quest'altra somma qui [$e^{AV} \sum P_k C_{in,k}$].

$$\sum_k P_k C_{out,k} = e^{A V} \sum_k P_k C_{in,k}$$

A parte questo termine [$e^{AV}$]. Quindi lo posso scrivere e posso dividere ambo i membri per questa quantità qua [$\sum P_k C_{in,k}$].

$$e^{A V} = \frac{\sum_k P_k C_{out,k}}{\sum_k P_k C_{in,k}}$$

No, perdono. Ok, la porto... $C_{in}$... sotto. E resto con un rapporto di somme, che sarà brutto però è quello che è. E a destra con $e^{A V_{in}}$.

Non mi piace l'esponenziale. *No problem*, applico ad ambo i membri il **logaritmo**, così da ammazzare l'esponenziale. Qui ho il logaritmo del rapporto di queste due somme, e a destra ho $A \cdot V_{in}$.

$$A \cdot V_{in} = \ln \left( \frac{\sum_k P_k C_{out,k}}{\sum_k P_k C_{in,k}} \right)$$
*(Ricordando $A = ZF/RT$)*
$$V_{\text{rest}} = \frac{RT}{ZF} \ln \left( \frac{\sum_k P_k C_{out,k}}{\sum_k P_k C_{in,k}} \right)$$
*(Considerando Na$^+$, K$^+$ (Z=1) e Cl⁻ (Z=-1))*
$$V_{\text{rest}} = \frac{RT}{F} \ln \left( \frac{P_{Na} [Na^+]_{out} + P_K [K^+]_{out} + P_{Cl} [Cl^-]_{in}}{P_{Na} [Na^+]_{in} + P_K [K^+]_{in} + P_{Cl} [Cl^-]_{out}} \right)$$

Trovo un'espressione stranamente simile al potenziale di Nernst. Qui non ci sono le $G$ [conduttanze], qui io sto vedendo le $P$ [permeabilità]. E continuo a vedere le concentrazioni (cosa che vi ho "nascosto" nella parte ohmica).

Ovvero: la parte ohmica per un ingegnere è semplice e immediata, sono delle resistenze. Al totale ci sarà una qualche resistenza che fa vincere... una qualche conduttanza che fa vincere, fa "pendere" il potenziale di membrana alla batteria che ha la conduttanza più grande, che fa vincere.

Qui è più complicato perché non lo vedo, però somiglia molto al caso di Nernst, in cui qui la **media è pesata sulle permeabilità** e continuano ad apparire le concentrazioni.

Quindi sembra che se... quindi dovrei rifrasarlo... qui addirittura la dipendenza è con il logaritmo, quindi è più sofisticata. Dipendentemente da quella che è la permeabilità della membrana a una specie o all'altra (compatibilmente con le concentrazioni della specie stessa), il potenziale di riposo pende per l'una o l'altra. Pende più verso il potenziale di inversione del sodio (che è +50 millivolt) o il potenziale di inversione del potassio (che è -80 millivolt)?

### 📈 L'Intuizione da Premio Nobel

Prima di finire vorrei (e fare 10 minuti di pausa) vorrei semplicemente disegnare quello che vi ho appena detto.

Quindi, ho detto che... dovete chiamare questo asse $V$. Qui, **+50 millivolt** (circa) è il potenziale di inversione del sodio. Quindi è $E_{Na}$, il potenziale di Nernst del sodio. Qui, **-80 millivolt** (circa) è il potenziale di inversione del potassio ($E_K$). È un pochino più depolarizzato... era -68 millivolt, questo è il potenziale del cloro ($E_{Cl}$), se proprio ci interessa.



Questo perché magari in alcuno di voi potrebbe venire in mente adesso di dire: "Se questo potenziale di riposo, che normalmente sta piantato qui [a -70 mV], dovesse cambiare rapidamente e andare, come durante un **potenziale d'azione**, andare verso +20 millivolt, e poi andare verso -80 millivolt, e poi ritornare a un potenziale di riposo...". Come sembra dalle tracce che vi ho fatto vedere, se avete l'occhio, se vi ricordate qualcosa.

Potrebbe essere strano, o interessante, il fatto che non ecceda questo *range*: +50, -80. Che sono esattamente, in certe condizioni, i valori massimi e minimi che una distribuzione di ioni sodio e di potassio permettono al potenziale di membrana di assumere. Se ci fossero solo quelli, e se le altre permeabilità sparissero (se le porte sono chiuse per il potassio e per il cloro, c'è solo la porta aperta per il sodio), allora questo è possibile.

Questa intuizione è quella che chiamerò nella prossima ora "intuizione da premi Nobel", perché qualcosa del genere ha permesso a Hodgkin e Huxley di prendere il premio Nobel, spiegando non soltanto la parte di riposo, ma la parte di azione.


## ⚡️ Eccitabilità

Grazie. ... il prossimo capitolo. Il prossimo capitolo è quello della **eccitabilità**.

La cosa che mi colpisce, o mi ha sempre colpito (al di là del fatto che io probabilmente ho 30 anni più di voi), è che comunque il chiarire l'origine e i meccanismi del potenziale di riposo, e poi della eccitabilità neuronale, non è qualcosa che si è sempre saputo da secoli e secoli. È relativamente recente. Recente della serie: negli anni '50. Meno di 60-70 anni fa, qualche anno più di 60 anni fa.

E non era così ovvio quello che oggi a lezione io vi racconto e in quattro e quattr'otto, spero senza troppe difficoltà, potete anche capire sia a livello quantitativo che a livello più intuitivo.

### 📜 Contesto Storico

La gente aveva iniziato a vedere che le caratteristiche elettriche di cellule eccitabili, come quelle nervose, non era costante nel tempo. Schizzava ogni tanto, in tempi molto piccoli, in frazione del secondo, nel millisecondo in particolare. Diversi personaggi, che sono indicati qui (ma solamente mi interessa farvi vedere le date), avevano inizialmente pensato che ci fosse una specie di propagazione in alcune parti della morfologia del neurone, nell'assone. Ci fosse una specie di propagazione di un'"irritazione" oppure di una propagazione di **correnti ioniche *inward*** (entranti).

Alla fine queste persone vedevano che il potenziale dentro rispetto a fuori (lo chiamo d'ora in poi $V_M$, potenziale di membrana; fuori è il mio riferimento che considero zero, perché ho un elettrodo di riferimento, io lo attacco nell'amplificatore, nell'altro spinotto dove segna zero), avevano visto che a un certo punto il potenziale di membrana diventava molto positivo. Quindi non era così strano per loro dire: "Boh, devono esserci delle correnti *inward*", che vuol dire entranti, e in qualche modo portassero delle cariche positive all'interno della membrana.

Fra parentesi, adesso che voi sapete qual è il bilancio della concentrazione di ioni dentro e fuori, potreste dirmi come potrebbe essere chiamato questo ione. Che ione è? [Riferendosi a Na$^+$] Non è calcio perché c'è solo un "+", non è cloro. Per lo stesso motivo per cui ce n'è tanto fuori, potrebbe essere che se succede qualcosa, per pura... in accordo con un... (fugge il termine)... con un **gradiente elettrochimico**, dato che ce n'è tanto sodio fuori, può naturalmente entrare dove ce n'è meno. E se questo succede, il potenziale potrebbe, dovrebbe, aumentare.

Non è stato così chiaro. Ci è voluto **Bernstein** e altri all'inizio del Novecento a pensare che non ci fosse necessario... fosse meglio non ragionare in termini assoluti di correnti, ma di **permeabilità**, di cambiamenti di permeabilità. Proprio per quello che vi è venuto in mente a voi, cioè: se c'è una condizione per cui se apro la porta entra un marasma di gente (perché ce n'è tanta fuori e poco dentro), forse la chiave di tutto è capire la permeabilità.

All'epoca... è stato fino agli anni '70 che la gente non aveva capito che ci fossero dei canali, dei pori della membrana. Hodgkin e Huxley non avevano immaginato che ci fossero dei pori. Pensavano che ci fosse una specie di trasportatore, una qualche particella carica elettricamente (perché ora vedremo perché carica elettricamente) che facesse una specie di ponte. Ma il fatto che ci fossero dei pori è stato visto negli anni '70 e '80 da **Neher e Sakmann**, due elettrofisiologi tedeschi che pure vinsero il Nobel.

*Vole*... fino al '40, prima della Seconda Guerra Mondiale (dove ci fu un'interruzione), era tutta gente in Inghilterra in un laboratorio a Cambridge molto, molto notevole, particolarmente Hodgkin e Huxley. Adesso non mi ricordo se Cole e Curtis erano lì o erano in un'altra università, adesso non me lo ricordo. Non mi ricordo se fossero in Australia. Comunque, durante la Seconda Guerra Mondiale si è fermato tutto.

E ci è voluto diversi anni dopo questa ipotesi di Bernstein affinché la gente misurasse un cambiamento di permeabilità. E questo cambiamento di permeabilità, Hodgkin e Huxley con Katz eccetera, l'hanno poi messo in correlazione a queste correnti entranti. E alla fine il modello meccanicistico, quindi la spiegazione meccanicistica che descrive come le permeabilità ioniche possano sostenere (e come debbano cambiare, che cosa cambia e perché) per generare o per spiegare il potenziale d'azione, si ebbe negli anni '50.

E la cosa interessante è che questi signori, che dieci anni dopo vinsero il Nobel (Hodgkin e Huxley), lo formularono con un **modello matematico**. Cioè, il tipo di matematica ed equivalenti circuitali che vi ho raccontato, a un certo punto diventa un po' complicato da fare a mano. Fin tanto che si tratta di invocare l'equilibrio o le condizioni di riposo (per cui la corrente totale è zero), questo è relativamente facile. Capire in un contesto dinamico, in cui le quantità cambiano nel tempo, è un po' più complicato. Come d'altronde l'analisi di circuiti che non siano circuiti lineari (fatti cioè da componenti lineari: condensatori, resistori, induttori, eccetera) non è necessariamente banale. Vengono fuori delle equazioni differenziali. Poi alla fine l'equazione differenziale è sempre quella, però in alcuni casi diventano equazioni non lineari, come quella che appunto è.

Quindi lo strumento del calcolatore elettronico (o meccanico, come era alla loro epoca) si rivela fondamentale per capirci qualcosa.


### 🧠 Piano del Capitolo sull'Eccitabilità

Seconda puntata di questo capitolo, si chiama eccitabilità, che ovviamente... *crescia*... Scusatemi.

In parte seguendo questo libro, **Sterrat**, e trovate anche materiale su **Abbott & Dayan**, che come ho detto forse la prima lezione e anche forse la settimana scorsa, contiene alcuni capitoli, qualche materiale (non è per intero), e questo Abbott & Dayan è molto più difficile come testo. E di nuovo, questi dovrebbero essere testi di supporto al vostro studio.

Quindi la partenza è quella che ci sia una concentrazione, una distribuzione di cariche e di ioni che non è omogenea fra dentro e fuori. Qui c'è il gattino, che è molto più dignitoso piuttosto che il paragone che vi avevo detto. Spero che in un modo o nell'altro, o con i gattini o con il sudore, possiate ricordarvi della composizione del fluido extracellulare.

Gli equivalenti elettrici li abbiamo visti. Vorrei cercare di mettere tutto assieme, di mettere in un circuito equivalente (non perché io sono ingegnere, ma perché Hodgkin e Huxley, che erano fisiologi, l'hanno fatto) sia le proprietà **resistive** che quelle **capacitive**. E le metto assieme perché vedo che sono tutti componenti equivalenti che possono essere descritti come tutti sperimentanti lo stesso potenziale extracellulare e intracellulare. Se sono in parallelo... se il palloncino che vi ho fatto, che ho disegnato prima, la membrana con i singoli pori e le singole correnti che in qualche modo insistevano in modo parallelo, non vi convinca già abbastanza, già a sufficienza.

Questo è il punto di partenza, lo sto ripetendo. E questo di nuovo a riposo. Grazie, l'abbiamo capito.

Vediamo che nel prosieguo... (vi avrei dovuto far vedere una cosa, più tardi mi fermo per far vedere il notebook dell'equazione di Goldman)... tiene fuori fra poco la solita equazione differenziale del primo ordine a coefficienti costanti. In realtà i coefficienti non saranno costanti, ma in una trattazione a parte che facciamo per semplicità diventerà esattamente quella a coefficienti costanti.

Vi ricordate che se volete rendermi felice, dovete fare attenzione che la variabile di stato (che ovviamente in un'equazione differenziale è una funzione) abbia un **coefficiente negativo**, perché va all'esponente e i sistemi biofisici, biologici, dovrebbero essere sistemi dissipativi. Dovrebbero non esplodere, ma spegnersi o comunque convergere a qualche quantità. Di sicuro non sono quantità che esplodono, perlomeno non esplodono sempre o in ogni momento.

Quindi avere comprensione, memoria, conoscenza di come si risolve questa equazione differenziale è essenziale. E anche come si "plotta" una funzione, come si deriva il grafico di una funzione del tipo: **costante + esponenziale**, dove l'esponenziale è decrescente ($k \cdot e^{-t/\tau}$).

Vi ho raccontato l'altra volta che posso immaginare che il termine esponenziale a un certo punto sparisce. "A un certo punto" vuol dire quando la variabile di stato... poniamo... è sufficientemente grande in valore assoluto. L'esponenziale di una quantità molto negativa è zero. Quindi a un certo punto questa quantità la posso trascurare. Questo modo di guardare alle soluzioni e alle funzioni matematiche alle volte aiuta, piuttosto che avere chiaro l'analisi funzionale di come si fanno i limiti, le derivate, la concavità... perché "a spanne" si può avere più o meno lo stesso risultato.


### 💡 Obiettivi Specifici

Quindi l'idea è quella di combinare questi aspetti capacitivi e resistivi in quella che viene chiamata **equazione del bilanciamento di carica**, in cui non considero più l'ipotesi di riposo, di *rest*, di condizione di riposo.

1.  Vi faccio vedere com'è possibile ottenere un **circuito a parametri concentrati**, nonostante sia la membrana sia un circuito esteso nello spazio.
2.  Poi in effetti vi ho già annoiato durante le prime lezioni in cui vi ho raccontato che i neuroni, descritti come le "farfalle dell'anima" da un grande neuroanatomico, sono degli oggetti spazialmente estesi. Sono tanto spazialmente estesi quanto può essere la distanza fra il mio tratto piramidale e il mio piede, in prima approssimazione. Quindi potrebbe essere che questa cosa delle descrizioni a parametri concentrati non sia valida sempre. Però adesso la consideriamo. Vi dirò perché, che cosa vuol dire "parametri concentrati" se non avete fatto qualcosa di simile in qualche corso su elettromagnetismo.
3.  E dato che si parla di equivalenti circuitali, vorrei **derivare il modello circuitale equivalente**. Di nuovo, l'ambizione è che guardando il modello io possa inferire delle considerazioni su quello che è il segnale elettrofisiologico che misuro sperimentalmente.
4.  Parlerò di un modello (questa è la cosa *latere* che vi faccio in modo semplice) in cui esce fuori la solita noiosa equazione differenziale a coefficienti costanti.
5.  Qui vi faccio vedere quello che tecnicamente viene chiamato l'**equivalente circuitale di Thévenin**. C'era anche Norton che era un amico, ma io preferisco Thévenin. Nel caso in cui le cellule non siano eccitabili (e adesso vi dico che c'entra con l'eccitabilità), permette di fatto di avere un **RC** [circuito Resistore-Condensatore] di cui forse avete già sentito o masticato.
6.  Quindi guarderemo come si può vedere la risposta a uno stimolo. E lo posso fare carta e penna, o comunque lo faccio, avete tutto sulle slide. E avere delle intuizioni sullo *steady state*, sullo stato stazionario.
7.  E poi c'è un esercizio in cui vi racconto **quanti ioni sono scambiati** durante un potenziale d'azione. Quindi quanto spesso dovreste mangiare banane e cioccolata per supportare il fatto che la maggior parte delle cellule nel vostro cervello adesso sta "sparando" come uno ossesso da diverse ore, da stamattina e anche durante la notte. Quindi, quanto metabolicamente è costoso essere eccitabili?
8.  E a un certo punto (non sono sicuro che lo facciamo oggi) vi parlerò di quello che è la descrizione cinetica, efficace, fenomenologica dei canali di membrana, che non sono tutti dei pori che stanno lì e non fanno niente. Sono delle strutture che cambiano in modo molto rapido (la zona geografica si presta al paragone: sono delle Ferrari del mondo molecolare, della biologia molecolare) perché sono in grado di cambiare forma estremamente rapidamente, con una frazione di millisecondo. Però non voglio fare *spoiler*.
9.  Questa descrizione è la stessa descrizione che molti di voi già conoscono nelle reazioni chimiche. Forse però nessuno vi ha fatto vedere che le reazioni chimiche (sodio più... cloruro di sodio), questa notazione con qualche numeretto sopra che forse avete indicato con le costanti $K_1$, $K_2$, quello che è, in realtà è un'equazione differenziale. Però nessuno forse ve l'ha raccontato. Si chiamano schemi cinetici marcoviani, a suo tempo.
10. E vi dirò che c'entrano con la descrizione completa, che combina *su* tutte queste cose di prima, il **modello proposto da Hodgkin-Huxley** per spiegare meccanicisticamente il perché avviene il potenziale d'azione.


### 🏛️ L'Equazione del Bilanciamento di Carica (Charge Balance Equation)

Quindi richiamo Lavoisier, del "nulla si crea, nulla si distrugge", e fra le altre ipotesi semplificatrici che avevo fatto, la principale adesso era quella del considerare a riposo, o allo *steady state*. Sarebbe stato più corretto dire che le grandezze non cambiavano nel tempo (-70 [mV] restava costante), quindi non c'erano grandezze che variavano nel tempo.

Tolgo anche quello, e vi anticipo che questo vuol dire che voglio mettere anche gli **effetti capacitivi**, che di per sé, di loro, hanno una caratteristica di integrazione temporale. Il condensatore (o capacitore) ha una capacità, accumula. È come la vasca da bagno in casa vostra o il lavandino: è un accumulatore. Quindi è un termine che ha "memoria". La memoria fa pensare al tempo (memoria non... ancora non memoria neurobiologica, ma memoria dinamica, di sistema dinamico).

E invocando la conservazione della carica, e quindi invocando Lavoisier, posso combinare le cose assieme.

In particolare, dico che il bilancio di carica totale è zero. Non si distrugge o non si crea la carica. In un sistema elettrolitico, nel mio cervello, in un neurone, non c'è una distruzione di carica e non c'è una creazione di nuova carica.

E i cambiamenti della carica ($\Delta Q$) nel caso della membrana di un neurone possono aversi per due motivi (ve l'ho già anticipato e sto insistendo nella speranza che non siano informazioni troppo complicate o troppo tecniche):

1.  Da un lato c'è lo **spostamento** (le correnti di spostamento, $I_C$). Non apro la porta, mi avvicino però sono molto carico positivamente... anzi, negativamente... e da fuori le cariche positive vengono per neutralizzarmi, però beccano il dielettrico, l'isolante. Quindi io so che nel caso di un condensatore, questa carica spostata ($\Delta Q_C$) dipende dalla differenza di potenziale ($\Delta V$). Differenza di potenziale che, per esempio, sto rappresentando nel contesto temporale. Di nuovo, prendo l'orologio, faccio passare un $\Delta t$, so che ci sono... quindi esprimo in termini di corrente ($I_C = \Delta Q_C / \Delta t$) questo rapporto $\Delta \text{carica}$ rispetto a $\Delta \text{tempo}$. Vuol dire: quanta carica è cambiata (ed è uno spostamento) nell'unità di tempo, $\Delta t$.
2.  E il **trasporto** (le correnti ioniche, $I_{ion}$). Invece è questa corrente... questa è una corrente di trasporto. È data da quelle correnti, non ha a che fare con la capacità, ma ha a che fare con quei flussi, o con le densità di corrente, determinate dai flussi ionici delle singole specie: sodio, potassio, calcio, cloro.

Quindi il totale della carica... *[erroneo nel parlato, si intende la variazione di carica]*... è la corrente per il $\Delta t$. E in questo caso [capacitivo] è data da $\Delta Q_C$.
Questo per il condensatore non c'entra il tempo... *[erroneo nel parlato, $Q=CV$ è la relazione base, ma la corrente dipende dalla variazione di V nel tempo]*. Questa è la differenza di potenziale ai capi della membrana, punto. Se io so quello, se io so quanto c'è ai capi della membrana, posso capire qual è il $\Delta Q_C$, la quantità di carica spostata.
Questa è la carica del trasporto ($\Delta Q_{ion} = I_{ion} \cdot \Delta t$) che richiede di ricordarsi che cos'è una corrente, che quindi è carica nel tempo.

Se questa corrente totale... *[la somma delle variazioni di carica]*... non cambia, vuol dire che...
$\Delta Q_C + \Delta Q_{ion} = 0$

*(Ricordando $Q_C = C \cdot V$ e $\Delta Q_{ion} = (\sum I_k) \cdot \Delta t$)*
$(C \cdot \Delta V) + (\sum I_k) \cdot \Delta t = 0$

...$C \cdot \Delta V$ deve essere uguale alla somma... scusate, $C \cdot \Delta V$ più questa sommatoria delle correnti per $\Delta t$ deve essere uguale a 0.
Quindi $C \cdot \Delta V$ uguale a **meno** questa quantità [$\sum I_k \cdot \Delta t$].
Prima erano tutti al primo membro, adesso ho spostato al secondo membro le correnti, cambiandole di segno.

E ho *fregato* loro... ho diviso ambo i membri per una quantità che non è diversa da zero (quindi lo posso fare), $\Delta t$.
Qui mi è venuto $C \cdot \Delta V / \Delta t$. Qui non ce l'ho più il termine di $\Delta t$.

$$C \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta t} = - \sum_k I_k$$

E facendo il limite per $\Delta t$ che tende a zero, di fatto questa cosa qua è l'**equazione costitutiva di un condensatore in parallelo con un parallelo di resistori**.

Però qui la mente da elettronico non l'ho dovuto utilizzare. Qui è il bilancio di carica. Infatti questa equazione viene dal bilanciare la carica. Incidentalmente, è la stessa equazione che Kirchhoff proporrebbe. E alla fine, ovviamente, i paralleli sono spiccati.

### 📉 L'Importanza del Segno Meno (Sistemi Dissipativi)

A proposito di rendermi felice o triste: notate questo **meno**. Queste correnti singole ($I_k$), se vi ricordate, erano $I_k = G_k \cdot (V - E_k)$.

$$C \frac{dV}{dt} = - \sum_k G_k (V - E_k)$$

Il fatto che ci sia un meno, al di là della convenzione se entra o se esce, si potrebbe aiutare mnemonicamente a pensare che quando scrivete l'equazione del bilanciamento della carica ($C \cdot dV/dt = \dots$), il fatto che ci sia un meno (che ovviamente io non lo ricordo mai, infatti lo sbagliavo quando ve l'ho detto ad alta voce un attimo fa, non l'ho considerato)... questo meno mi fa **invertire** questa differenza.

Questa differenza ($V - E_k$) incidentalmente è anche un nome, si chiama ***driving force*** (non è la forza elettromotrice). È un termine forzante: avendo un particolare potenziale intracellulare, per quella specie ionica il fatto di essere più o meno distanti dal potenziale di Nernst gli causa una corrente più o meno intensa.

O... il meno diventa qualcosa che diventa $G_k \cdot (E_k - V)$.

$$C \frac{dV}{dt} = \sum_k G_k (E_k - V)$$

Quindi io sono contento perché c'è il **meno $V$**. Quindi non dimenticatevi questa cosa per rendermi contento: di buttare un occhio sul fatto che quello che scrivete o che vedete scritto (quello che in teoria potreste numericamente validare con una simulazione al calcolatore) potrebbe non esplodere, non dovrebbe esplodere.

Perché questo sistema, nonostante sia un sistema elettrico, ionico, è un **sistema dissipativo**. I canali ionici sono sistemi di trasporto **passivo**. Non è necessario consumare ATP di per sé per far funzionare gli ioni. Consumate ATP per far funzionare le **pompe ioniche**, che sono meccanismi di trasporto **contro** il gradiente elettrochimico. Quindi [se] sono uno ione sodio, ho bisogno di una pompa ionica per farmi buttare fuori; ho bisogno di energia perché fuori c'è un sacco di sodio.

Comunque, vi prego di farmi felice perché qui è la stessa variabile di stato, $V$, che compare con un esponente... *[errato, intende coefficiente]*... negativo.
Lo so che qui ci sono un sacco di termini ($G_{sodio}(E_{sodio} - V) + G_{potassio}(E_{potassio} - V) \dots$), ci sono tanti... Però concettualmente, se anche sono tanti, è facile che questo termine "meno" propagato possa comunque giustificare l'esistenza di un sistema dissipativo. Quindi di soluzioni che abbiano qualcosa a che fare con esponenziali decrescenti e non esplosivi, che non vadano le grandezze biofisiche all'infinito.


### 🔌 Il Circuito Equivalente (Modello a Parametri Concentrati)

Quindi questa equazione qui non è altro che il **parallelo** fra un condensatore e una serie di resistori (ovviamente resistori con anche delle batterie).

Questo è lo schema circuitale di un pezzettino (viene anche chiamato *patch*, "toppa") di membrana, in cui vedete che il doppio strato fosfolipidico è indicato come equivalente a un **condensatore ($C_m$)**. Quindi se io sono uno ione, mi fermo qua, non vado dentro perché lì c'è un... anche energeticamente sarebbe impossibile, avrei bisogno di un sacco di energia per farmi spingere dentro. Proprio come nei condensatori avete bisogno del cosiddetto *breakdown* del dielettrico per avere una corrente di trasporto all'interno di un condensatore. I fulmini sono un esempio di *breakdown* del dielettrico e ovviamente avete un'energia enorme. Qui non "bucate" fisiologicamente il dielettrico della membrana.

Però, se siete uno ione, potete (come avevo fatto nel disegnino dell'altra volta), se il canale vi fa passare (perché è quello selettivo a voi) e se il canale è aperto (potrebbe essere magari come la porta chiusa), vi fa passare fra da dentro a fuori o viceversa.



Qui ho indicato anche la punta di un **elettrodo di vetro**, quello che vi ho mostrato durante le prime due lezioni, perché in teoria la punta di questo elettrodo (che vi ricordate contiene un filo di argento-cloruro, che azionato opportunamente da una corrente elettronica rilascia o si "succhia" una corrente cloro)... Quindi io qui in teoria "sputacchio" o "succhio", quindi interagisco con l'ambiente ionico intracellulare. Ed è come se questo possa essere caratterizzato da un circuito equivalente pari a un **generatore di corrente ideale ($I_{ext}$)**. Quale che sia la caduta di potenziale ai capi della membrana, la corrente è quella che metto io. Adesso non ne metto perché voglio vedere cosa fa il neurone. Se voglio magari stimolarlo, butto qualche decina o centinaio di picoampere (nel caso di una pipetta e nel caso di un neurone di mammifero sarebbe una corrente abbastanza tosta).

Però la membrana è estesa. E quindi ci sono tanti canali. Vedete che alcuni canali sono di tipo diverso, infatti la batteria è orientata nel modo diverso. Nulla da capire, è solo per me per ricordarmi che alcuni sono per il sodio ($E_{Na}$), altri sono per il potassio ($E_K$), e ognuno ha un potenziale di Nernst che non è uguale, addirittura ha delle differenze di segno (quelli del sodio sono +50, +56 quello che è; il potassio è -80, eccetera eccetera). Quindi non sono tutti identici. Al di là del fatto che sono dei canali che sono selettivi solamente a una specie ionica, ma elettricamente io me ne frego che siano selettivi a una specie ionica. Però le batterie, il segno e l'ampiezza, devo tenerne conto.

Quindi una cosa che si fa... (che finiva così senza suspense, pensavo che apparissero... qualcosa che non me lo ricordavo)... uno potrebbe dire: "Ma non è che per caso posso **semplificare** questo circuito che adesso in questa configurazione ha parametri distribuiti?"

Quindi in teoria, o meglio, no, è sempre a parametri concentrati, soprattutto perché i punti qui all'interno e all'esterno sono isopotenziali. Non c'è una resistenza che descriverebbe (o dentro o fuori) una differenza di distribuzione, una differente distribuzione di potenziale elettrico cambiando il punto. Però potrei decidere di semplificarlo perché sono noiosi da gestire eventualmente carta e penna.

### 📚 Richiami di Teoria dei Circuiti (Leggi di Kirchhoff)

Quindi vi faccio dei cenni di cosiddetta teoria dei circuiti, o elettrotecnica, in cui non ho un approccio veloce, ve lo rammento soltanto. Non ho un approccio astratto e formale che richiederebbe quello di invocare la teoria dei grafi e dire che un circuito è una collezione di nodi e di archi... (non vi ricordo come si dice *link* in italiano)... nodi e *edge*. E per ciascuno di questi nodi io posso associare due grandezze elettriche. Lo posso fare arbitrariamente. Posso queste grandezze elettriche orientarle come voglio, quindi avranno un orientamento, orientazione algebrica. Posso fare quello che voglio, purché poi io sia consistente.

Quindi la faccio molto più semplice di così. Vi ricordo che queste quantità vengono utilizzate nelle cosiddette **Leggi di Kirchhoff**, discendono da principi fisici dell'elettromagnetismo:
1.  **Prima Legge di Kirchhoff (Leggi delle Correnti, LKC):** Della conservazione della carica. Dato un qualunque nodo, la somma algebrica ($\sum I$) di tutte le correnti che entrano o escono (con segno) è **zero**.
2.  **Seconda Legge di Kirchhoff (Legge delle Tensioni, LKT):** Nel caso della circuitazione uguale a zero del campo elettrico, quindi dovuto alle proprietà conservative energetiche del campo elettrico. Il percorso che faccio (vado da qui a qui e poi qui... un percorso chiuso, quindi una maglia) ha la somma ($\sum V$) di quantità di queste grandezze elettriche di potenziale... la somma algebrica, presa con i segni, con un verso che volete (purché siete consistenti), la somma è **zero**.

Quindi una cosa che si fa in elettrotecnica o in elettronica, si può scegliere (ma è puramente convenzionale) è la cosiddetta **convenzione degli utilizzatori**. In cui dati due nodi, tipicamente si prende il potenziale ($V$) orientato così (con la freccia che va all'insù) e la corrente ($I$) che va all'ingiù. Semplicemente perché nel caso di un utilizzatore, di un componente passivo, di una resistenza, l'equazione costitutiva di una resistenza dice che se tu prendi il potenziale orientato così e la corrente orientata così, **$V = R \cdot I$**. Con questa convenzione. Se no avrebbero dei segni diversi. Ha a che fare con il fatto che... con la solita storia del dislivello, il paragone con il potenziale gravitazionale: se uno ha una differenza di quota, ha un flusso di carica. Il dramma è che si pensava che fossero cariche positive a condurre le correnti elettriche. Quindi se vedete la lezione scorsa o due lezioni fa, la carica positiva, quando il campo elettrico è orientato in questo modo, si muoverebbe scendendo, come la massa fa quando c'è un dislivello di quota (un fiume va a valle, non risale una montagna). Però questo è rimasto e la legge di Ohm funziona con queste assunzioni.

Non è fondamentale. Vi sto raccontando queste cose, primo: per suggerirvi, se non le avete fresche, magari di riguardarvele. Se non le avete mai fatte, potreste essere curiosi, potreste essere ambiziosi a dire: "Ma perché ci vuole un genio per avere un'infarinatura di teoria dei circuiti?" No, non c'è questo. Era in particolare questa cosa del senso di inferiorità... era particolarmente vivo quando ero in Belgio, in cui gli studenti non avevano un background tecnico e quindi dicevano: "Ah no, io non sono un fisico, un matematico, un ingegnere, non lo faccio". Prova. Vedrai che è semplicemente una roba di algebra, non serve particolarmente altro.

Qui lo uso soltanto per farvi vedere che quel parallelo di resistenze e condensatori (perché anche il condensatore è una proprietà in teoria distribuita) possono essere compattati in un punto.


Quindi, in teoria, ho bisogno di tutti gli strumenti dell'analisi dei circuiti, che vi ho in parte già proposto senza in effetti fare un richiamo formale. Queste sono le equazioni di Kirchhoff. E gli *hardcore*, diciamo gli appassionati di elettrotecnica formali dicono: "Ah ok, io ho un numero di equazioni uguale al numero delle incognite e quindi qualunque circuito io lo posso descrivere, posto che mi dai l'equazione di Kirchhoff e le equazioni costitutive dei componenti".

Comunque:
* **Equazione delle correnti (LKC):** Tra ogni giunzione (cociclo, nodo, come lo volete chiamare... l'importante è che questa superficie chiusa non intersechi la parte, per esempio, di un componente come un resistore o un condensatore, non entri dentro, perché altrimenti le ipotesi dell'elettrotecnica non valgono più, bisognerebbe ricorrere all'elettromagnetismo). Ci sono dei video di YouTube molto interessanti di Veritasium, che è un divulgatore eccezionale, che forse l'anno scorso ha parlato proprio di fenomeni di propagazione elettrica, della corrente o del campo elettrico che si muove nello spazio. Comunque, se vi interessa vi do il link, è molto bravo. Quindi, equazione di Kirchhoff, la legge di Kirchhoff per le correnti: la somma delle correnti è zero ($\sum I = 0$). La carica si conserva. Alla fine la corrente è carica per tempo ($\Delta Q / \Delta t$), $\Delta t$ chi se ne frega, $\Delta Q$ totale uguale a zero, quindi si conserva.
* **Equazione delle maglie (LKT):** O i cicli (*loop*). Il potenziale, la somma algebrica per qualsiasi maglia o ciclo che parte in un punto e *ritrova*... torna nello stesso punto, coinvolgendo quanti nodi voi vogliate, fa sì che la somma sia zero ($\sum V = 0$), dove sono grandezze orientate. Questo è dovuto alla conservatività del campo elettrico. Questa è conseguenza della circuitazione (se avete familiarità con le equazioni di Maxwell) del campo elettrico. Ma comunque, queste sono richiami eventualmente per risuonare in chi di voi ha queste informazioni.

### 🧾 Equazioni Costitutive dei Componenti

Le equazioni dei componenti, alla fine:
* Il **condensatore** e la **resistenza** sono gli unici due componenti che vediamo (a parte forse i generatori ideali di corrente e tensione).
* **Resistore:** $V = R \cdot I$
* **Condensatore:** $I = C \frac{dV}{dt}$

Sono le uniche equazioni che abbiamo in effetti già masticato. E tenete conto che valgono così se prendete queste convenzioni, che è la convenzione degli utilizzatori (se prendete la tensione che punta in alto e la corrente che va nel senso opposto, per motivi di cui vi ho detto). Quindi $V$ è $V$ qui in alto meno $V$ in basso, ma tipicamente vuol dire, scrivendo così, $V$ è la differenza di potenziale tra questi due punti.

Nel caso di un induttore... non li vedremo mai perché non esistono, o perlomeno non sono apprezzabili i fenomeni induttivi nel caso della biofisica delle membrane eccitabili e dei neuroni, delle cellule eccitabili in generale.

Quello che vediamo è, al limite, le equazioni costitutive di una **batteria** (o generatore ideale di tensione) o **generatore ideale di corrente**:
* **Generatore di Tensione:** Sono molto facili. Se il generatore di tensione è $V$ (ripeto, presa così la $V$), $V = E$. Dove $E$ si pone che sia positiva, ma anche se negativa è uguale. $V = E$, poi sarà $E$ che se la gioca lei quello che è il segno, se magari cambia nel tempo non importa.
* **Generatore di Corrente:** $I = A$. Dove in effetti dovete fare un pochino più di *tensione* [attenzione], perché per i generatori vale un'altra convenzione, che è quella dei **generatori** (convenzione degli *utilizzatori*... [errato, intende "dei generatori"]), in cui corrente e tensione sono allineati e vanno nella stessa direzione.

Se li mettete in un circuito elettrico in cui avete un generatore di tensione (in cui questa è $V$, in cui questa è $I$) e questo è un resistore (per esempio il circuito di una lampadina a incandescenza), capite perché la gente ha utilizzato questa convenzione in cui dal generatore la corrente ha quel segno. Quando è positiva... se fosse negativa, amen, avrebbe segno meno. Comunque, questa è una convenzione che potreste dover sapere, però ripeto, non credo che lo utilizzerete mai nel caso della... se non probabilmente per la descrizione... ok, se andate a fare ingegneri neuromorfi, ovviamente, però dovreste masticare i circuiti *per sé*.

### 🧠 Esercizi: Serie e Parallelo

Prima di fare il break, l'interruzione. Un possibile esercizio per derivare su questa base:
1.  Il perché due **resistenze in serie** hanno una resistenza equivalente ($R_{eq}$) che è la somma delle resistenze ($R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2$).
2.  E invece un **parallelo di resistenze** è equivalente a una resistenza che ha come resistenza un valore il cui inverso è la somma degli inversi ($1/R_{eq} = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2$).

Se fossero conduttanze:
1.  Il parallelo è la somma delle singole conduttanze ($G_{eq} = G_1 + G_2$).
2.  Per le conduttanze, la serie di conduttanze sarebbe una conduttanza equivalente il cui valore, il cui inverso, sarebbe la somma degli inversi ($1/G_{eq} = 1/G_1 + 1/G_2$).

Si può fare esattamente con le leggi che vi ho raccontato, mettendo cioè equazioni costitutive a ogni nodo delle grandezze elettriche di tensione e di corrente. Se volete, ripeto, lo possiamo fare poi assieme.

Queste sono le equazioni di Kirchhoff per questo nodo e questo nodo [circuito serie], e questa è l'equazione dell'unica maglia che è presente da questo nodo a quest'altro e ritorno. Queste sono le equazioni costitutive. È un sistema di $n$ incognite in $n$ equazioni. A un certo punto riuscirete a farlo a occhio, a vedere che visto che non c'è nessun filo che "esce" qui... dal punto di vista idraulico, è come se aveste un tubo che ha una certa portata con del liquido qui, quindi quello che è il flusso di liquido che entra qua deve conservarsi, deve continuare a essere qui e deve continuare a uscire. Quindi sì, $I = I_1$, $I_1 = I_2$. Però a un certo punto forse dovreste vederle a occhio queste cose qui, se non già le vedete a occhio. Però [lo dico] semplicemente perché qualcuno di voi mi ha detto che non è fresco, non è particolarmente a suo agio con i circuiti per il proprio background. E questo è legge di Ohm ripetuta due volte.

Se fate la stessa cosa qua [circuito parallelo], dovreste in qualche modo fare la stessa cosa per questo circuito di sinistra e per questo circuito di destra. E capire quando le due relazioni fra $V$ e $I$ (quindi fra questa $V$ e fra questa $I$, che è la stessa che c'è qui... fra questo e questo e la $I$ grande che c'è qui) diventano uguali. In questo caso vedreste che l'unico modo è che la $R$ equivalente qui è $R_1 + R_2$. Qui dovete chiamarlo in un modo diverso. Mentre qui [parallelo] vedreste che è un pochino più fastidioso, ma è algebra.

Ok, questo se volete, di nuovo, lo potete fare per conto vostro e sono a disposizione se avete problemi. È semplicemente mettere dei numeri, perché molte volte queste cose restano appese. Supponete di avere questo tipo di circuito, che potrebbe essere il potenziale di Nernst del sodio, e due... in effetti in questo modo qui non sarebbe biologicamente realistico, dovrei cambiarlo e farlo biologicamente realistico. Comunque, avete due resistenze in parallelo.

La prima domanda potrebbe essere: ma qual è la tensione ai capi di queste due resistenze? Qui, anche se uno non ha rudimenti di Kirchhoff e non invoca Kirchhoff, lo si vede: che fra questo punto e questo punto il potenziale elettrico è quello imposto dal generatore. Quindi $V$ è noto. La cosa che non è nota (perché di nuovo, nel parallelo idraulico, nell'analogia idraulica, qui qualunque cosa esce si confronta con una biforcazione, una parte entra qui e una parte entra lì)... quindi dipende. Allora lì ho bisogno magari di usare Kirchhoff.

Potrebbe non essere comunque così strettamente necessario se pensate che la corrente potrebbe avere una difficoltà maggiore o minore di andare in un percorso a resistenza maggiore o minore. **La corrente va nella direzione di resistenza minore**. Come d'altronde... non le biciclette, ma anche le biciclette se sono in caduta libera in una valle... sto pensando alla discesa del gradiente in *machine learning*. Quindi un torrente va giù, segue la direzione lungo il potenziale (gravitazionale in quel caso), ovviamente scegliendo il percorso che ha meno restrizioni. Però nel caso idraulico non è... ma forse sì, anche nel caso idraulico lo è.

Per fare questo esercizio dovete scrivere semplicemente l'equazione di Kirchhoff a questo nodo e le equazioni costitutive. Trovereste la corrente che scorre in ognuno di questi resistori, oppure la corrente che scorre qui in questo parallelo di resistori.

Potrebbe essere interessante perché quando la membrana è un parallelo fra la conduttanza sodio, la conduttanza potassio e la conduttanza cloro, voi iniettate della corrente... potrebbe avere un interesse. Quindi non avete un generatore di tensione. In effetti ci sono delle modalità sperimentali in cui si può applicare (si chiama *voltage clamp*, ma non ve ne parlo) in cui si può applicare una tensione. In quel caso la corrente che voi vedreste è quella che viene dal percorso a resistenza minore, o a conduttanza maggiore, come intuitivamente uno si aspetta.

Se avete problemi me lo dite, sono a disposizione. Qui era la storia del partitore resistivo, per chi di voi ha vaghe reminiscenze di elettrotecnica, in cui appunto, mentre la corrente segue il percorso alla resistenza minore, il potenziale si divide proporzionalmente con la resistenza. Ma non è cruciale.


### 🧠 Semplificazione: Parametri Concentrati (Lumped Parameters)

Prima di interrompervi vorrei allora dirvi: che cosa ne faccio di questo equivalente circuitale in cui ho un sacco di condensatori in parallelo, con intermezzo anche dei tanti canali? Ne avrò qualche decina di milioni di canali sodio, uno vicino l'altro... magari non sono tutti vicini, ma per me tutto è isopotenziale in questa membrana, in questa cellula potenzialmente sferica, isotropa e uniforme.

Quindi ho un sacco di condensatori in parallelo e un sacco di resistenze in parallelo. Non è che posso scrivere un unico condensatore che ha la **capacità equivalente ($C_{eq}$)**?
* **Per i condensatori** è facile, e anche per le conduttanze è facile. Perché se voi immaginate l'espressione della capacità ($C = \epsilon A / d$) che scalava linearmente con la superficie ($A$) e inversamente con la dimensione fra le due piastre ($d$), potreste pensare che questo caso qua [parallelo] è come se voi steste mettendo (in effetti lo state facendo) dei condensatori a facce piane parallele, uno in *conduzione elettrica* [connesso] all'altro. Quindi è come se steste ampliando la capacità. E quindi la **capacità totale equivalente è la somma delle capacità** ($C_{eq} = \sum C_i$), perché la superficie totale è la somma delle superfici.
    Quindi nel caso della capacità è semplice e intuitivo, e vi basta. Se volete però "rompere il capello", dovreste scrivere $I_i = C_i \frac{dV}{dt}$ (equazione costitutiva) per ciascuno di questi condensatori, e scrivere, visto che tutte quante le correnti devono conservarsi (la loro somma algebrica deve essere 0), potreste scoprire che questo è equivalente a scrivere tante volte $I_{tot} = I_1 + I_2 + \dots = C_1 \frac{dV}{dt} + C_2 \frac{dV}{dt} + \dots$. E vedete che $\frac{dV}{dt}$, visto che è condiviso, può essere fattorizzato. Quindi lo potete anche vedere algebricamente.
* Mentre **per le conduttanze** con in serie una batteria è un po' più fastidioso, però concettualmente... se voi avete non una porta, ma avete (perché qualcuno spacca per lavori di ristrutturazione e fa tante aperture), è ovvio che sia come conduttanza, permeabilità, la possibilità che voi possiate in un caso di incendio fuggire da questa stanza aumenta. È più facile, siete facilitati se non avete soltanto qui e lì (avete un ingorgo). Se ne avete di più, la corrente può distribuirsi. Di nuovo, la corrente totale è la somma delle correnti; la **conduttanza [equivalente] è la somma delle conduttanze** ($G_{eq} = \sum G_i$).
