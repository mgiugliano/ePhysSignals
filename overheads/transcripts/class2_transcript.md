### **Part 1: Course Preliminaries and Announcements**

#### **Introduction and Technical Difficulties**

Ok, I'm sorry that last week part of the lecture was not recorded. Those little microphones have a limited battery and they left me stranded. If you see it during the break with the microphone, please give me a signal because I will at least try to save [the recording]. I have a second ambient microphone, which is not great, but since it was not offered by the university, I have to buy it at my own expense. To be sure, there will be a bit of an echo, but you are here, so it shouldn't be a problem for you.

Okay, so today we continue and we finish this introductory content that I'm quite eager to present to you because in this way, concerning brain signals, you have at least an exposure to what kind of signals you can get.

#### **Attendance Tracking**

So that is the code for the tracking of your attendance. I emphasize it again: I don't really care. It's just for me for statistical purposes, to see or to disprove the hypothesis that for the first couple of classes you are brave and attending. As soon as I start writing some equations—maybe we start already today—you get scared and you don't show up to class. So please disprove me. It's not the QR code. The QR codes, I should remove them. The QR code is to download the app. It's the numeric code, alphabetical, **DC8R9**, that you have to add. So, if you have troubles during the break, I will put it on the slide again.

#### **Special Announcement: Guest Lecture**

An announcement. On Friday, we are very lucky, because we have quite a superstar coming to give a class for the entire morning. The program, as you know, is in Mirandola. This is part of the Colloquia in Bioengineering, which is actually a course that I give for the second-year students, or for your colleagues who started last year. And just because he's the one world expert—you can google him and you will see that he's very, very famous. He's a professor at EPFL, not only in Italy, at Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna. He's doing neuroprosthetics, particularly in amputees, restoring not only motor function but also sensation. He has a number of publications in very important journals: *Science*, *Nature*, and so on and so forth. The only catch is that it's in Mirandola. I don't know about the shuttle bus. Your colleagues from the second year told me that it was maybe for 25 seats. And they are less; there are probably 15 people, 16 people. They were fewer last Friday. So you could try to sneak in, and you could try to be on the bus and to try to go to Mirandola, or you try to travel to Mirandola on your own. Maybe you could ask the university to get refunded. There is the other logistic problem: the room that they showed me that will be next for next Friday has 25 seats. So if you all decide to come, we will not fit. Maybe we can have extra seats, but I would say I hope that I can invite him again next year, but you never know, particularly with very important people. They have a very busy schedule, so there is no guarantee. Yeah, please. No.

### **Part 2: The Scale of Neural Interfacing**

#### **Section 1: Neurons and Electrodes: A Matter of Scale**

There are still worse infrastructures. I have brought up the talk about the brain; you want to talk to neurons. And I ask myself, I ask for you, if you know how big is "big." So particularly, what is the rough size of a neuron, say the body, the cell body? Do you have any idea? How big is it? Nanometers? So, one nanometer... it's a little bit bigger. It's one order, three orders of magnitude larger. It's on the order of maybe 1 micrometer, 10 micrometers. The soma, the cell soma is around, I will show you in a moment, a micrograph is around 10 micrometers in diameter. And the very fine processes, the branches that branch out, the dendrites or the axons, they can be much, much tighter; they can be a fraction of a micrometer. But nanometer, no. But anyway, this brings up very interesting observations. Maybe you heard about the field of nanotechnologies and nanomaterials. It means that today we do have materials and possible devices that are smaller, a thousand times smaller than living cells. So in principle, you could think of answering the second question about "what about electrodes?" So in this case, I'm particularly referring to the deep brain stimulation electrodes, which are massive, as I tried to tell you. But I think in 10 years, electrodes, even those of Elon Musk's Neuralink, will become nanometer-sized. We can already build things that are nanometer-sized. One example, I don't know whether you've heard of it, is called carbon nanotubes, which are very tiny, and also silicon nanotubes and other materials, but carbon nanotubes are particularly interesting because I work with them, trying precisely to interface them with neurons. If you're smaller, like a Trojan horse, *Cavallo di Troia*, you could maybe think of putting something in the "stomach" of the neuron and maybe you're not injuring the neuron. And we will see why the injuring, the stabbing, this idea that I had that with an electrode you may puncture a neuron, will become maybe more delicate if you just have a very tiny needle that the neuron will not even know is there.

Now, any idea about these deep brain stimulation electrodes? Last week, I showed you the guy with Parkinson's that has an immense improvement in his motor symptoms. It's purely symptomatic, of course. And I told you that that technology is directly taken from heart pacemakers, with small modifications. So what do you think if these neurons are 10 micrometers in diameter? So, on the order of micrometers, what do you think these electrodes should be? Micrometers, but in reality, do you know how big they are? Just for you to think that people undergoing surgery, neurosurgery, to have these things inserted, they don't have a nanoscopic thing, but they have big stuff. Do you have any idea?

I'll show you, I think in the next slide. This is a sort of cartoonish reconstruction of a piece of cortex. It's only one type of cell that is depicted; it's the one that I like most. They are the pyramidal cells, and they are pyramid-shaped because their cell soma (somata, if it's plural) is shaped like a pyramid, and then you have this very long apical dendrite. It's called apical. From Greek, "apo" means "far." Right now we are going into the wintertime and the planet is getting closer to the sun, in the perihelion. But in summer we go to the aphelion. Anyway, so it's called "a privativa." And here you actually see the basal dendrites. And the axon here is not depicted, it's not reconstructed. This is a real example of a cell stained with a color technique, with a dye technique, invented by Camillo Golgi. And it's from the visual cortex of a cat. And here you see, purely by geometrical comparison, the very tip of a tungsten electrode. So if this thing is around maybe, again, tens of micrometers, then the tip here of this—this is an experimental tungsten electrode; it's a needle, it's an antenna—in research labs, it's probably maybe one micrometer or less. But see, in a moment, coming from there, you will see a huge deep brain stimulation electrode if it comes... come on... Yes. So it's immense. And imagine the big damage that it's causing. And the electrode is not like here, the very tip, that has not been insulated. There was here a USB-C cable that I wanted to play with. So you probably see that here it's all insulated with the exception of the tip. The tip, I'm just making it simple, the tip is metal. But here, so here I can get electrical signals; here no because there is insulation. So here is the same; here you don't, it's insulated by some plastic or Teflon. Here you have just this huge ring that is metal. It's typically platinum, and this is the insulation. There are maybe more than one active electrode. So you see, it's huge, and it is a massive damage to the structure of the brain where it is inserted.

#### **Section 2: Challenges in Neuroengineering**

So the challenges of the future, some of you will face, and they're still open in neuroengineering, are the fact that with these big electrodes, if you want to talk to the neurons, you're not selective. It would be like me shouting at you, instead of wanting to give a message only to one of your colleagues. Not because of privacy, but because I want him or her to receive and to listen to my voice, not the entire class. Otherwise, if I scream "fire, fire!" all of you will get panicked and will leave the room. Instead, I want only maybe one of you to leave the room, just making stupid examples. It's one of many stupid examples that I do, but it maybe gives you the analogy of why the stimulation is non-selective. And by the way, I cannot talk to a neuron on the basis of its genetic identity. If you are excitatory or inhibitory, it doesn't matter, provided that you are in the range of action of this extracellular voltage stimulation, or current stimulation, electrical current stimulation, you will be reached by the stimulus. Instead, I would love to talk only to those of you who are excitatory neurons. I can't today. Not with electrical stimulation. I can do it with optogenetics, but we will talk about that another time. With recording, if you want to listen, they are discontinuous and again non-selective. It would be as if during the break I start to listen to you, whether you are bored, whether you are hating my classes or not. I cannot, I can hardly distinguish your voices and I will hear a huge summation of all the voices. For diagnostics, for the EEG, electroencephalography, maybe I can live with that, but I'm more interested in understanding the information content of individual cells, and today I cannot do that.

And then there is an important thing, which is the fact that any tissue, any biological tissue, after you put in an implant, you might have a sort of inflammation and therefore tissue rejection of the foreign body. So the electrode starts to be immediately recognized as a foreigner and, as you know, particularly the brain has a very peculiar immune system as opposed to the rest of the body. The brain is encapsulated in the blood-brain barrier, which is easy to remember because it's BBB, blood-brain barrier, and it has its own immune system where you have cells that are called glial cells, *cellule della glia*. They immediately engulf whatever foreign object or bacteria or whatever, because it's so severe that if an infection occurs in the brain, you're not surviving. So evolution made it in a way that is so exquisitely reactive and so tight. So there is no rule. It's like in a cloud where you cannot enter, not even if you're invited. Well, maybe the blood-brain barrier can be fooled, but that's another story. Drugs, neuroactive compounds, are smaller than the pores of the blood-brain barrier, and they can enter.

And then there are issues with the information content. I have no code, I have no translation, no dictionary, so I don't know how to decode the signal. And something that is still not particularly developed, but it's a topic of bioengineering and neuroengineering in general, is the fact that you can also match experiments with mathematical model computer simulations. There is an entire course in the second optional course, only for those of you with a neuro-curriculum that I'm teaching. I started teaching it on Friday afternoon in the fantastic venue of Mirandola, just because your colleagues are already there.

### **Part 3: Modern Approaches and Modeling**

#### **Section 1: Advanced Electrode Technologies**

So the alternative, these are experimental directions that I would like to tell you about in one minute, just because I work on these solutions. Instead of having a massive electrode, maybe you could use an array of nanoscopic or, say, microscopic needles. So these are microwires, and these are even silicon nanowires that are even smaller. Here you see a comparison; this is an electron microscopy picture, scanning electron microscopy. You see that these things are so tiny, so the aspect ratio, which is the ratio between one size and the other of the geometry, is very high, meaning that they're very tall and very, very small, very tiny. They could actually penetrate maybe the membrane. So in this case, you don't see those that are vertical and they are where this neuron is sitting on. And in general, over the past maybe 10 years or so, some of these concepts have been used. So not only you have a piece of metal like this one and you keep it as an antenna, maybe you try to get closer to the speaker, you get closer to the neuron, but you want maybe to bring... this is inappropriate to say... So if the deity is not coming to the mountain, maybe the mountain comes to the deity. And so the idea is to have needles or protruding, three-dimensional electrodes, and you try to get closer to the neurons. There is one particular research that we play with in which, because neurons are so reactive, and so if you are not friendly with them, they will try to reject you. What we thought is that if we were to have some sort of structure that was decorated—so these are gold protruding three-dimensional microelectrodes that could be connected in the substrate—so if you decorate, if you attach to them, by some surface chemistry technique, some protein that makes the neuron think that that's food, it's not gold, it's not a metal electrode (in this case it's gold because chemistry is easier), maybe the neuron can be brought to embrace, to phagocytose. Technically it's called pinocytosis, but all cells are eating; it's called phagocytosis or endocytosis. But of course, if the neuron tries to engulf or embrace or phagocytose, the electrode will not be able to be broken by it. So it's not a particle or bacteria that the cell can, or food that the cell is trying to encapsulate, and then internally it cannot break it. But in this engulfment, the proximity between the electrode and the cell will be exquisite, will be very small, and if you pass a small current, you are guaranteed that you are talking only to one guy, because it's that one that is hugging you, not all of them. And it kind of works. So here you actually see, it's a work that was, it's a European project actually that I coordinated and it featured many collaborators from many countries. And I'll make a long story short. So here, indeed, at least in vitro, that means that we did not do it—well, we did not succeed at doing it in vivo in animals—cells, rat cortical neurons, seem to embrace these protruding things. This is the lateral section of one of these mushroom-like shape electrodes. And what you actually see here on the top of these electrodes, these are carbon nanocubes, for reasons that I'm not telling you.

#### **Section 2: Mathematical Modeling in Neuroscience**

So another thing that is very important is about the modeling part. So not only improving the technology, microfabrication, nanofabrication or nanotechnology, but also looking at mathematical descriptions. And we are going to use, to exploit, even in this course, mathematical descriptions to understand things. And maybe you are aware of this, maybe not. So this is just for purely historical reason. The equations that in 1952, two physiologists—so not engineers, not mathematicians, not physicists, two physiologists—wrote, it's a differential equation that describes, if you solve it, if you have a computer solving it, how the nerve impulse looks like as a function of time. So it goes up very rapidly, and then it goes down, and then it recovers, and then it goes to around minus 70 millivolts. And these two physiologists were so cool, they got a Nobel Prize in the 60s. They were so cool that they formulated an electrical equivalent circuit model. Of course, neurons are not circuits. They are not capacitors. They are not resistors. But you can have, by analogy, that the biophysics of cells is behaving with the same equations as the physics of electrical circuits. And this is very powerful, for instance, inspiring a field, neuromorphic engineering, where people are building electrical circuits that are mimicking neurons. Both are electrical devices, so why not have them in hardware?

This is one example of a big 10-year project that was concluded recently, a couple of years ago. It's called the Human Brain Project, in which individual models, mathematical models, with all this morphology, can be incorporated in a supercomputer, in a high-performance computing system, and all these differential equations associated to these hundreds of thousands of virtual neurons can be solved, and the communication between neurons can be studied. Here, it's a pretty movie where the color is encoding for the electrical potential. If it's red, it means that the membrane potential is positive, say plus 20 millivolts. If it's blue, it means that the membrane potential was minus 70 millivolts. Of course, people did more interesting things than this three-dimensional fly-through, which is purely aesthetic. To some extent, it's not particularly useful, because the only thing that you can see here is that maybe you get red, and then you get bluish, and then, okay, here it's too short to see. So maybe it's some sort of global... because the entire network was in a kind of synchronization, global oscillations, just to tell you that people are using that.

Out of curiosity, how many of you know what a supercomputer is? Any suggestion? Can you tell the others? Can you tell what particularly is fancy or not fancy about a supercomputer? "Ma perché hai un microprocessore bello carrozzato?" (But why do you have a nicely beefed-up microprocessor?) Things faster. So the only way, and I told you maybe last week that we are already doing it on, even on mobile phones, we are doing a sort of parallel computing with multiple cores, and a supercomputer is a collection of nodes, literally computers attached with Ethernet cables in a network. And so if you run a simulation, that's your responsibility, you can distribute the job. So you can distribute the program across many computers. So, and how would you run a simulation of a piece of brain on a supercomputer, having said that it's a collection of hundreds of thousands of computers, of cores or processors? Any idea, what would you exploit in this parallelism of the electronic hardware? How could you make it work? In principle what people have been doing is having one neuron per processor. To mention how difficult or how computationally intensive it is to simulate only one neuron. So if the brain is a collection of things and they are communicating, maybe you could do the same if you have a collection of processors and the processors are communicating with an internet local area network cable. Just for you to be curious.

### **Part 4: Electrophysiological Signals: From Single Neurons to Networks**

#### **Section 1: The Visual System: Hubel and Wiesel's Discoveries**

Now, I would like to give you some examples of brain signals that have this electrophysiological component. And I'll mention, I will start with the work in the 60s of two researchers. They were both, I think, medical doctors. And the guy here is the author of the book that I suggested to you, that is in the readings, in the GitHub repository. I strongly recommend you to read it. It's very light. Probably it will take a couple of weeks if you read a little bit of it. But it's a tiny book. Of course, as a PDF, you don't have any indication of how big it is. So David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel—this guy is today 102 years old, 101 years old, I was surprised. I am happy. They both got the Nobel Prize in 1981 for their discovery on the visual system. And they made experiments looking at the electrical activity, at electrophysiological signals of neurons in a cat, anesthetized, and they were recording from the occipital part of the cat's cortex. It would be as if, but I'm not suggesting it, someone would stick an electrode into your brain, into your occipital cortex, while you're staring at this screen. They didn't have a video projector, but they had a system where they could, you'll see in a moment, project stimuli, light stimuli, say for instance a small white dot, and they could change the position of the dot, they could change the diameter of the dot, etc. Maybe they could show a bar, we will see, while the animal, anesthetized with its eyes open, was staring at them. And of course, one objection is clearly the animal is anesthetized, so you're not guaranteed that the brain is actually processing information in the same way, and this is a well-taken objection. On the other hand, sensory systems are normally not necessarily affected by anesthesia. What matters with anesthesia is that your cortex usually is like when you dream, particularly during slow-wave sleep, when you are in the second phase of sleep; you are basically disconnected from the sensory system. There is a station in between that is called the thalamus, and the thalamus is like a gate, and the gate is closed while you sleep. Possibly because if the phone rings, you are not necessarily reacting. The cortex is not... maybe the cortex can still dream, but it's disconnected from sensory systems, with the exception of one sensory system that is very ancient, which is olfaction. The olfactory bulb bypasses the thalamus. It's going directly into the cortex.

So I will show you some recording. Why the animals... and what they did, they had an amplifier, and they connected the amplifier to a loudspeaker. So if you have a very fast transient, you probably know that if sounds are made of frequencies, and Fourier proved this, and if the changes over time are very abrupt, it means that in the frequency domain you have a very broad distribution of energy. If it's broad, it means that it's also broad for high frequency, in the frequency domain for high frequencies, that means you will hear it. And you hear it as a sort of "tak-tak-tak-tak-tak." During the weekend I was playing radio and I was trying to make contact with Morse code. My radio has a decoder. Just to give you an example in which in this case you have small sounds that are short, "dit," and longer sounds that are longer and they are "dah," and you will hear it. And the guy in a moment is giving some numbers and gives his name. He says "operator is..." So here is different, because we don't know the codes that neurons are using. And we don't have two symbols. For Morse code you have brief and long, it's digital. You also have the pause, but that's another story. For a neuron, you only have when the neuron is firing. And the interesting thing is, okay, when does it fire? It could be that it fires not once, it fires a given number of times, and so maybe the frequency of firing is making sense.

Now you will hear about one neuron that is very close to the tungsten electrode, so we only hear its voice. We are sort of confident that we only hear from one neuron. And the animal is staring at the screen. So you will be staring at the same screen. And in this case the recording has been done in the retina, in the outer layer of the retina, which is called the ganglion cell layer. I'm here and I'll ask you to pay attention, to try to do, although you can't because you don't have the Rosetta Stone, the dictionary, like I tried to do during the weekend, tried by ear to decode the message. So here the question for you is just be aware, be concentrated, just to try to understand when this neuron is responding. And the neuron is responding with a sound. You will hear—it's why they call it neuronal firing, *sparo*—you will hear it in a moment. Second is, not only when or what is the neuron responding to—maybe it responds when it's dark, maybe it responds when it's light, maybe it responds with a particular shape. Maybe some of you heard about the story of the "Jennifer Aniston cell." A few years ago, there was a paper showing that a patient, a human patient, awake, with an electrode, had one cell that was only showing, only firing, only responding, when the patient was shown pictures of Jennifer Aniston. It was not always the same picture. It could be Jennifer Aniston at the beach, Jennifer Aniston drinking coffee, Jennifer Aniston in the early morning. So it was not the same picture. And that cell was not in the visual cortex; it was more in the associative areas, say, in the frontal areas. Listen. Here is different. But the question would remain: Jennifer Aniston would not be shown, but what features of the stimulus are exciting the neuron? And so, if you are very advanced, you could start thinking, assuming, and I tell you that these neurons are performing some sort of information processing, some computation, what kind of computation is it? So here it is. No. I want to use that loudspeaker. This is me, and it's not a mirror. *coughing* I'm going to go.

Do you want to see it again? Or do you have some ideas? Go ahead. "Naturalmente." (Naturally.) In fact, that's why they were trying maybe to have an elongated stimulus instead of a focused stimulus. Maybe they tried to change the size of the stimulus. They tried to make it dark in the center and light around. And if you were careful, you could hear that the neuron was firing sometimes differently, sometimes not differently. Go ahead. No, the retina, ganglion cells. And in a way, being in the retina means that it's already a major complexity in terms of information processing. It's not like a webcam. It's not a pixel of the webcam, for sure, because you could see that it was doing something strange. It was not responding to... So apparently there was one area that was indicated by, so it was written, highlighted on the paper, on the paper screen. I cannot write on this screen, otherwise they will kill me. So that one is called the receptive field. And people, so they actually tried to search for it, tried to see what is the area of the world, in the sensory part of the world, where if you have a stimulus there, the cell is responding. Because if the cell is around here or here, it's not responding selectively to that stimulus.

Let me show you it again with some commentary. It seems that it needs to be there, in the circle. But it seems that it's also responding when the light is much larger than the small circle. At least now, with this, it seems to be the case. I'll throw some random ideas because it's very, very interesting. And they could do, of course they did some quantitative analysis, but it was just because they could hear and they could see these correlations that they understood what these neurons were doing. And then of course it's about almost 70 years of research trying to understand how this is done.

One thing that you notice is that the neurons are also responding spontaneously when there is no light. They are not completely silent. Normally, so they have a spontaneous activity. Let me very briefly... Sorry... Ah... Spoiler... So even when the stimulus is not around, the cell is still having some spontaneous activity. Maybe it could surprise you, maybe not. After all, we are 37 degrees Celsius temperature animals. So there is some noise, and even the systems that we are building in electronics, they are noisy. So it's not a surprise that if you don't do anything, still the system is responding. But it's not responding strongly. Something that maybe those of you who are maybe musicians will hear is that when the light is on, you may hear some sort of "zzzzz" and then the sound frequency is decreasing. It's as if you hear this. So there is some sort of what is called adaptation, some sort of slowing down. And this is interesting because it's in all evolutionary sensory systems. You also have it in your skin. You have sensory receptors in your skin. And if somebody would grab you from the back right now, you would startle. You would be scared. You would have a reaction. There would be a reflex arc, *un arco riflesso*. It would be perfectly normal. But of course, now you are probably wearing your shirt or whatever, t-shirt or whatever, on your shoulders for many hours. And you're not completely aware of it, but you still have it on your skin. It's because your sensory cells, in that case they are mechanoreceptors, here they are not light receptors because these guys are not really, they're not light-sensitive per se. It's the last layer of a chain of processing, but these guys are also losing interest. If the light is there for too long, at the beginning they respond, but then it relaxes. Because maybe evolutionary what matters is if a tiger enters the room. So it's the change. When the world changes, then I have to take notice. If the world is stationary, it's boring. But that's another story. And there are things that you might hear. So when the light is off, still you hear spontaneous activity. But look what happens now. So it seems that if you have light all around, but in the middle, in the same receptive field, you have darkness, then things are a little bit different. Could you understand? Could you not? Could you hear it? What was the difference? No, the retard that you feel is because when they are on the stimulus there is a rebound and the cell starts to fire. I will show you why it is crucial. You have to feel what you do immediately before the stimulus is given. No way. Could you hear it? It might have shut off. So if you have dark in the center and light around, it stops. And if you have one particular orientation or another one, it's the same. So any more ideas? Any other things that you noticed? You heard it on this slide, you have all the comments that we could make.

So, one is that there exists a space in the sensory world, in the world, that is called a receptive field. It's a field that, if the stimulus is there, the cell is responding to. So, you could probably imagine that other cells, so other neurons sitting nearby, would respond to a different receptive field. There is no orientation selectivity, suggesting that there might be other cells, maybe not in the retina, maybe there are other cells that would have some preference, some preference for a particular orientation. Here it's bright and here it's dark. So maybe it matters if you have these contrast differences. And the cell is firing nerve impulses, even spontaneously, but at a low rate. And another thing that was interesting is it's not doing it as a pacemaker, but it's doing it like a sort of Geiger counter, like in radioactive Geiger counters. It seems to be random. It's a random process. And just opening and closing a parenthesis about this randomness: Even Mandelbrot, the mathematician who studied these Mandelbrot sets, these beautiful things, fractals that you might have heard of, he was also studying neurons because of their stochastic properties, the fact that they are irregular and they are kind of unpredictable. And technically, the best model is a Poisson point process, for those of you who have vague reminiscences of stochastic processes in probability theory.

When the light is in the center, it fires, but when the light is around and in the center at the same time, there is a little bit of suppression. Sorry, no, no, sorry, sorry. This means that if you have the black spot in the center, so if the light is in the surround... So, we have a distinction between surround and center. It's a sort of ring, and then the center can be... so there can be light in the surround and darkness in the center, or vice versa. And if it's vice versa, it responds. If it's instead darkness in the center and light around, then you have suppression. So, yeah, the cell is firing normally spontaneously, but when darkness is in the center, it actually is also even suppressed, even below the spontaneous rate. And the cell fires if the light is everywhere. And something that I told you, it's not... if I should depict it graphically, you will see that there is some sort of fatigue. So the rate, number of pulses per second, number of sounds per second, is decreasing in time. Please. Of course, of course, absolutely. The image that you see of me and of your colleagues is the result of a population code. Each cell is like this. It seems that cells are highly specialized, but cells are connected in a network. And the connectivity gives rise to these emerging properties. This one, it's only isolated, and we could understand that this one was specifically caring about that receptive field, and it was what is called a center-surround cell. And in this particular case, this one is center-on, surround-off. There are other cells in the retina, and the ganglion cells that are the opposite. They will be center-off, surround-on. So they would fire with a different logic.

And in the story of on and off or this center-surround, the fact that you have contrast, darkness around, darkness in the center, or if you have darkness in the center this one was suppressing, instead the other type with darkness in the center would be instead more excited, is the basis of one typical operation of image processing that maybe none of you today with this generative AI models, with Sora, with Gemini, whatever model for generating images, you probably never played with Paint software or Photoshop. But maybe you did, I don't know. Okay, something that is also important is that switching off the light causes a rebound. So when the darkness was in the center, the cell was silent, all was silent. But then when the light was removed, when everything was removed, there was some sort of rebound. So before there was some spontaneous activity, and also later there was spontaneous activity, but during the presentation of the darkness, there was silence. And then here there was a little bit more, like a rebound, like when a drug addict is not consuming his or her drug, then, when you remove this inhibition, when you disinhibit, it has a rebound. It has some sort of abstinence crisis. Here, in engineering terms, you can see that this is a sort of high-pass frequency filter. So, it actually doesn't want to respond to some steady input. It wants to take the derivative, and you probably know that the derivative of a step... Maybe you don't like the step. Assume that the light is switched on with some ramp. You know that the derivative here is zero because here it's constant in time. Here it's also zero because it's constant in time. The only time when the derivative is non-zero is here, when there is a peak. So these cells are doing derivatives. And of course, when you are switching off, so here you also have some sort of derivative. So these cells are still a high-pass filter and they respond to the change, to the transitions. And other cells are showing the opposite.

About computation, did anybody play with Photoshop? Or with any image processing things? Did you ever apply filters? There are filters to extract things. So there is one thing, if you can, if you have any software that could do some elementary image processing, try to play with it. If you apply a spatial derivative filter, which is enhancing whenever there is a contrast difference, whenever there is a light and dark, you extract the edges. So if you have a picture of my face, you will actually process it with this. Maybe I can try to do it, but I don't have Photoshop on my computer, but I will try. You end up with a picture, with a new picture, in which whenever there are areas that are not having contrast changes, they are dark, because in space the derivative is a derivative of something that is uniform, like here the derivative of a constant in time is zero. The derivative of an area that is roughly uniform is zero. But what matters are the edges. And indeed, you would extract the edges. So the retina, it's an oversimplification, is an edge detector. Here you don't actually see it because with the edges, you would actually say, "No, look, I would like to have an understanding if the edges are vertical, are horizontal," because if they are vertical, I could probably say, "Oh, this guy has a big nose and it's vertical. It's in the middle of the face, so that must be a face." And by the way, this seems to be the way we recognize faces, but not in the retina. So for me to enter the room, for me it's very important to see vertical transitions, bright and dark. And something that is interesting is that retinal prosthetics, this artificial device that was implanted in the eye, since it was stimulating ganglion cells electrically, probably was getting for free some spatial processing, so these edge detectors. And so it's a contrast detector. It detects edges. Because in the end, you could probably... it's boring to see, with the exception of when I write, it's boring to see or to devote energy or information, even metabolic energy, to the world, to represent the world in your brain when everything is uniform, when it's not interesting. You have the impression that the brain is filling in, so you actually see that there is a wall that is white, but no cell is responding to the white. The cells, you have cells that are responding to the transitions, which makes sense because you have very limited resources. If you have to build a system with a few hundreds of thousands of detectors, maybe you want to optimize and not have something that is pixel-by-pixel related to the intensity; you want a way to extract some information that is relevant for behavior. I'll stop here by asking, and we'll start later, how if you could, even if you know nothing about how the retina is wired, but imagine that you have at least one layer that is photoreceptors, like a camera, like a CCD camera, pixel and pixel and pixel, how would you build the circuit for a ganglion cell to receive this information and to relay it downstream, to extract edges? How would you do that? Knowing that in the center there is a positive response, it's a sort of excitatory response, and in the surround you have some other field, and if you have light in the surround but not in the center, you are inhibiting the cell. We'll stop here for 10 minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

#### **Section 2: The Neural Circuitry of Center-Surround Fields**

Okay, let me restart. Let me again ask you the same question about how we build it. How we build a system that is center-on, surround-off or vice versa. So, let me say that I have this... This would be the photoreceptors. Receptors of the retina. So here, maybe you can imagine that there are pixels. And here you have this neuron that is the one that you were recording its electrical activity from. And there is an area of the world on the screen that was projected through the lens inside the retina. So you could say the receptive field on the screen was actually mapped onto an area that was probably circular, because the lens is a linear system, and so unless there is aberration... Okay, it's not an ideal lens, so there will be some non-ideality, but on a first approximation, a circle in the world would be a circle projected in my retina. So you will have different pixels, different sensory photoreceptors. By the way, they are called cones and rods. *Coni e bastoncelli*. I believe that in elementary school, in primary school, you heard abundantly about that. I don't care about the... of the eye. I don't care. What is cool is that the cones, if I remember correctly, those are for the colors, are specialized in red, green, and blue, which is the typical... from the medical bonus that you regulate. Again, if you're playing with Photoshop, this is what you play with. But that's another story.

So how would you make it in a way that... so this would be the surround, and again here you have a lot of other cells, and these cells are, they have axons, they have output wires, okay, and they are like all the neurons, they are very eager to connect, because being in isolation is a crack for people, cells, societies, countries, etc. And so, how would you wire, what would be the wiring diagram of this system, which I anticipate is not correct, but it doesn't matter. Just for you to do the exercise. So what you have is the possibility to distinguish between synapses that are excitatory and synapses that are inhibitory. An excitatory synapse would be a synapse that, if it's activated, will excite the target. For the moment, I will not tell you about... Maybe Zoli might have started telling you about biochemical signals and might have already told you about neurotransmitters, excitatory and inhibitory. Did he do so? Yes. So you know already about the story. So why? No. So glutamate and GABA, gamma-aminobutyric acid, are two of the main central nervous system neurotransmitters. One is excitatory and one is inhibitory. So you have that some synapse could, you could choose it. So you could have excitatory or inhibitory at your will. This may not be entirely correct, but that's what we'll talk about later. And this is your target. So this is your post-synaptic cell, post-synaptic neuron. And this is the ganglion cell that we recorded from. Hubel and Wiesel recorded from it. So this is... It's in the ganglion layer. It's a ganglion cell. And this is, for instance, surround-on, center-off. No. Surround-on, surround-off, center-on. That doesn't matter. So just if you tell me that here you want to have light, when you have light here, and these guys are activated, I want this guy to be excited. How do I do it? How do I connect? Can maybe some of you come to do that or you tell me how should I wire? So here I have axons. Give me some ideas. What's the difference? What's the difference in terms of cables at this level of understanding that I'm trying to pass to you? You have processors and you have connections. Connections are, I'm inclined to think they are feed-forward, so they are not recurrent. You don't have bidirectional connectivity, and they are feed-forward. So it's like the perceptron, although maybe you know or you don't what the perceptron is. You have some sort of algebra, that you have excitatory, which is making the post-synaptic cell go up, and inhibitory to go down. Down in a supposedly excitatory, excitation state. You want to favor or you want to depress. If I have an inhibitory synapse and I'm projecting to one of you, if I'm excited because you shine light on me, but the synapse is inhibitory, when I'm excited, I will secrete GABA and my post-synaptic target will be depressed, will be silent.

So what I'm trying maybe to inspire you to do is to see whether maybe you would connect the center with excitatory synapses. And the surround, if the surround is off, I made a mess here, okay, where the surround is off, so if I have light only in the surround, like the one that we have seen, if the light is here, these cells of the retina are excited, but this guy is silent. So I was hoping that maybe you could have said, "Okay, so this cell is going to be excited." It's a photoreceptor when light is invading it, but the axon is projecting with an inhibitory synapse. So all here are inhibitory synapses from the surrounding, and from the center you have the plus. You can try to think of this conceptual model, and it works. At least it works explaining some of the observations, not all. And in fact, we know now that this is not how things work in the retina. But it's interesting because just by a simple algebra, you could have that some projections are like on a car, are accelerating, others are like brakes, and they are stopping the same neuron. The post-synaptic neuron, you can think of something that is making the summation. You could think of a capacitor, and it would not be a wrong assumption, that is summating inputs. The capacitor, as you know, it's an integrator in time, it's integrating the signals, and it's keeping memory, right? In the charge, in the plates.

And so, in order to get this, this is the same thing, but not with sound, but with traces. If the light is in the center, you see, before there was spontaneous activity, then here, this is when the light was switched on, the frequency increases, and here, if you squint your eyes a little bit, you see that here, the number of small pulses is with higher density. So there, I don't bump on the table, but I bump here. So it's... So here it's higher spikes or pulses per second, and then it's relaxing. Here it's... okay, here when you switch off, it goes back to spontaneous activity, which has even lower activity. Here, when the activity, when the light is in the surround, you see here it's truly silent. Well, not entirely, there was one random pulse emitted, but it's really suppressed. So it means that when the light is in the surrounding, you probably have to invoke some inhibition, some inhibitory mechanism to brake the same post-synaptic cell. So the connections, the wiring, might determine the function. And here is if you have light on the entire thing, what happens is that you have both at the same time, you have activation of both the excitatory and the inhibitory synapses. And the fact that here you have more spikes means that, okay, these synapses from the center are either more numerous or they are more effective, they are with a stronger coefficient. So yes, true, you are doing simultaneously the averaging, the arithmetic combination of both the excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Excitatory, I imagine, like positive numbers. Inhibitory, there will be negative numbers. Okay, here, the excitatory numbers are winning. Fine. Not particularly shocking. What was important for me is to push you at least once to try to think about these circuits.

#### **Section 3: Higher-Order Processing in the Visual Cortex**

Now, I'll show you what happens if you record in the visual cortex. So, a couple of stations, of relay stations... I'm skipping the thalamus. In the thalamus there is a region that is called the LGN, doesn't matter if you know it or not. In the Hubel book, *Eye, Brain, and Vision*, *Occhio, Cervello, Visione*, it's indicated. So you have all these things explained in a very nice way. Here we are skipping the thalamus. We are directly recording in the primary visual cortex. Because as you can imagine, there is a hierarchy of areas in the cortex for vision. Like in deep networks. By the way, they were directly inspired by the visual system. So here is a cortical cell. And again, the question is the same. What is the feature the neuron is responding to? Where and what is it? And again, what are the specific features that are making the neuron fire or maybe be inhibited? And what computation? Is it the same computation? No? No? No. No. Okay. It will get a little bit better in a moment in the video. It's from the 80s or earlier. So it's actually putting some plus or some... So even here, you have a receptive field, but it's not circular. You have the same thing that when the light is on, you have a lot of spikes and then there is adaptation. And it seems that if you excite a sound in the periphery, it's sort of silenced. Okay, it's not writing minus, but this is like the surround-off of a moment ago. There it was a ring, here there is a direction preference, also for the off-response. It's a little bit more difficult to hear because you have less spontaneous activity here. It doesn't work. You need to have the exact orientation, otherwise you excite both, you illuminate both the on and off centers. So it needs to be 45 degrees. If it's like this, the response is much less. So there is a tuning preference. The quality of the stimulus has to be tuned to the correct angle. If it's everywhere, it means the "off" part. And the fact that here you hear the rebound is because you are in the off part. Now you are both in the on and off part. So the on wins.

So this is called simple cells. There is one orientation. This cell was specifically responding to that, and this is another sort of silly cartoon for a wiring diagram having different ganglion cells, so these are different ganglion cells, each with its own receptive fields, they are particularly aligned on the same line. So, because these four cells have receptive fields that are aligned, if they all project with an excitatory or inhibitory synaptic connection to this cortical cell, then you will get this preferential direction-selective cell.

This is another example, which is more interesting. It's still in the visual cortex. Let me know if you understand what this is doing. What is this doing before the guy writes something that will spoil it? Could you see it? Only seems to be direction-selective... Ok, I spoiled it. Not only is it orientation-selective, but it's also direction-selective. It's only when the stimulus goes from right to left that you have the response. In the other direction, it doesn't work. It only works if you have something moving in one direction. You can try to think whether you can do a sort of circuit, a functional circuit like this. You will see that it's not trivial because what is happening here is that you have time. You have movement. So it's not that straightforward. You could try. It could be an interesting mental experiment. So in this case it's both orientation and direction-selective. Which is very cool.

Something that I mentioned last time, I wanted to clarify, I don't know whether... So I mentioned retinotopy as well as tonotopy. Tonotopy was in the auditory processing areas of the brain as well as in the cochlea. That's why cochlear implants are doable, are not easy, but they are doable. Retinotopy is the fact that points nearby in the world are projecting to points nearby in the retina, and they are, I tell you now, projecting to points nearby in the visual cortex. So in principle, if you want to restore vision in a blind patient, you could think of having a camera, and if there are two pixels of the world nearby, you could stimulate two points in the cortex that are nearby in the cortex. There is a small caveat which is interesting enough. We are over-representing what is in the exact center. If you keep your eyes straight, it's called the fovea. So it's not like a CCD camera. This one is 4K. It means that it has 4K, 4000 pixels, or 4 million pixels, it should be 4 million pixels, and they are uniformly distributed in the plane of the sensor. There is no area in which there are more. If you had it, you would have a hard time displaying the images because you don't have more pixels and your screen would need to accordingly have more pixels in the central part. We do that because when we read or when we have to do something very carefully, we need maximal spatial resolution. And so the only way is to have the largest number of photoreceptors. But in the periphery, you can try, I cannot read. I cannot read these letters if it's, not only because I wear glasses, but I don't. I see that there is a bottle, and that's maybe okay for if a tiger enters the room while I'm looking at you. But if I want to read, I have to bring it into the fovea where I have the maximum resolution. In the cortex you have this sort of deformation which I'm not telling you about here. Many, many years ago they did an experiment with a macaque monkey staring at a screen while being anesthetized. So the gaze was fixed, there were no saccades, there were no movements, it was fixed. And immediately after they could process the cortex, they sacrificed the animal, and immediately after they processed the tissue and they could see where the areas of the visual cortex were most metabolically active. So they could basically have some sort of imprinting of the image, at least radioactively, to tell what's in the cortex, where the neurons were that were most active. And this, I admit that it's not a technique, or it would deserve more explanation, but it's not worth it, it's not crucial. There is some sort of deformation.

#### **Section 4: The Brain's GPS: Place Cells and Grid Cells**

I'll show you another example of electrophysiological signals. These are more higher-order, they are not related to sensory systems, and they resulted also in a Nobel Prize a few years ago, it's about 10 years ago. John O'Keefe is a UK researcher who first studied the hippocampus and found something very cool that I'll show you in a moment. And then two Norwegian researchers that were, before they were a couple, Moser and Moser, who studied similar experiments in the entorhinal cortex. And they were, as you can see, this is not about vision, it's about behavior and cognition and navigation. And it was worth a Nobel Prize. But again, I ask you to pay attention. What you will see is not an animal. We will not be recording with electrodes attached to a loudspeaker. You will actually see the top view of a small arena in which a rat is moving. And the animal has one electrode implanted in the hippocampus. So the animal is not anesthetized. He is awake and behaving. And whenever there is, in this recording, a nerve impulse, just because I'm recording the video, I actually put where the head of the animal is in that moment, I put a small red dot. So if the cell, if I'm here and the cell is firing, then I put a red dot so that it will stay in the plane of the image, it will stay that when the animal was here, the cell was active. It will make sense in a moment. So pay attention. I'm asking you whether you can understand when or what this neuron is paying attention to, and what computation it might be useful for. Computation meaning maybe what kind of behavior, what kind of something that maybe you do, maybe not every time, every day, that you probably are doing.

So this is the top view. This is a big rat. And you see that the red dots are at that moment in time when there was a pulse recorded by the electrodes implanted in the hippocampus. And the experimenter is giving some treats, some food, so that the animal is exploring an otherwise boring arena. Typically after a while, animals are not exploring; they are getting bored. And there is one specific receptive field, if you want, that this hippocampal neuron is responding to. What is it? It's relatively easy. Any idea? No. I'd say I have no time, maybe I can replay the video, but it's not so complicated. Say now even when the hand is not there, ok, it's difficult because it's accelerated, but even if there is no one in the room the cell would perform the same way. It's only that the rat may not be willing to move around. So it's only when the animal moves and explores the arena that something in the hippocampus happens. You know that you can even answer, even propose, I don't care, even if it's a crazy idea, I'm not saying, I'm not judging and remembering, "Ah, this guy was at the exam..." I don't care. I would love to invite you to think, to be critical, to formulate hypotheses, to try to be curious, to feed your curiosity. "Potrebbe avere ragione, ma non è." (You could be right, but you're not.) "E qui, purtroppo, la mano è disgraziata perché arriva sempre dalla stessa parte." (And here, unfortunately, the hand is a nuisance because it always comes from the same side.) Because you are thinking about the visual system, but it is not.

So these cells are called place cells. And the Nobel Prize was given and in the news—you were probably not even born, or you were born ten years ago, you were younger—and they said, "Found the Nobel Prize because..." because people explained the GPS that is inside the brain. GPS is the global positioning system that you use with your mobile phones maybe to find whatever pizza or ice cream place, *gelateria, antica gelateria*, whatever, where you navigate. So your hippocampus is specifically helping you to navigate because it allows me to orient myself, and there is one hippocampal brain cell in my brain now that is firing and it was not firing when I was there. When I'm here another cell is firing. So at every moment I know where I am. It doesn't come for free. I need a few minutes to explore the surrounding because I need to create, to integrate information about visual, maybe other sensory modalities saying over there there is a lot of noise and maybe there is a very nice aroma of chocolate or perfume, here there is instead a bad smell. All the information integrated gives rise to these place cells and it's surprising, it's fantastic that you have neurons encoding space. The... okay I'm not saying the Euclidean space but it's... it's amazing. And to make some sort of circuits like this for place cells is a much more, it's a harder endeavor. If you have 20 minutes, there is a nice TED talk from a few years ago by Matt Wilson, who is a researcher at MIT, that is also telling you that when you sleep, you are replaying the sequence of activation of place cells. While the animal, or even myself, is creating, is moving, is navigating in the environment, different place cells are activated in sequence, and when I'm asleep, I'm replaying the sequence. I'm replaying the sequence of activation, because this is, maybe it's something that I have to consolidate. I have to sleep so that memories are consolidated. Spatial memories. I need to go there, because there might be some chocolate, or there was a nice smell, or a perfume or whatever, and I might need to concatenate, correlate all the place cells that finally led me to find here the chocolates, and I was really rewarded. I have to remember the street. If you use a mobile phone, you are probably not having this. It's very cool because when you are still, when the rat is still, or when it's in non-REM sleep, you have this replay of memories. It was particularly interesting, I don't remember whether it is in this talk, is a collaborator of Matt Wilson that I worked with, I collaborated with when I was in Belgium. The animal, still awake, not sleeping, was replaying the sequence and people could see the sequence of cells replaying, possibly because the animal had to plan ahead where it wanted to go. Extremely surprising because it deepens the understanding of the mechanistic functioning of the brain.

I'll show you another one that is in the entorhinal cortex. Same exercise. It's a little bit more complicated, but it's still related to space. And I wonder whether you see it. And this is particularly interesting. It is still for navigation, but you will see that it's interesting. Here it's a mouse. It's not a rat. And it's a smaller arena. And it's the same drill. I don't remember whether now there is food. There is no food. The wire that you see is because the electrodes are connected. And here you see again one small dot that is added to the image when and if the animal was there, there's a spot, and the recording electrode was detecting a nerve impulse. So clearly it's not one preferential spot, like a corner or like the front of the board here, of the desk. And after a few... this was... it's truly remarkable. It's a Nobel Prize and they got the Nobel Prize. It's amazing. For those of you who have some interest in science, or mathematics, or geometry, here it's surprising. I'm not, of course, it's not my field of research, but it's surprising that in the brain of an animal, you have some element of Euclidean geometry. Do you see what kind of, sort of, graphical, geometrical shape is resulting? So what I'm trying to delineate here is that it seems that these blocks of activity are not random, it seems to be at regular spots, and I could maybe build either hexagons or triangles. And maybe some of you, particularly if you had to renovate your kitchen or maybe your house, you know that in mathematics there is this idea that in order to cover a surface with a given geometry, I might have, depending on the geometry, if it's a triangle, if it's a hexagon, if it's a pentagon, I might have an easier or more difficult life to tessellate, *tassellazione* of a surface. And the triangle or the hexagons are the primitives that are able to tessellate, so to subdivide in domains, in regular domains, any surface, any flat surface, of course. That's why I kept saying a couple of times Euclidean space.

So these cells are called grid cells, for obvious reasons. And the grid, this is one cell. One cell has this tessellation, and another cell will have a tessellation that is might be rotated or scaled or translated, offset. It's what is sort of giving the underlying substrate for place cells. So it's only because you have these that you can get place cells. And again, you could, if you have grid cells, of course it will not be the retina, it will be some sort of space-effective domain, you could try to see how grid cells project to place cells in this sort of diagram, this sort of wiring diagram.

#### **Section 5: Network Activity *in vitro***

Something that we will also see is that electrophysiological signals can also be recorded from isolated portions of the brain. In this case, these are recordings done a few years ago in our lab, in which you don't have a rat, you don't have a mouse, you don't have a monkey. You have a bunch of cells that have been removed and digested enzymatically. They've been cultured. You probably know about cell culture. You've heard about cell culture. And these cells are plated on a chip, basically, like the one that I showed you last week. And these small things that you see here, small dots here, are the cell bodies. You don't see the dendrites and the axons because they are very, very highly packed. They are very tightly... the concentration of cells is very high. And because this is a microchip, these are metal electrodes. It's as if the chair where you are sitting is made of metal, like the example of an otherwise isolated antenna, an isolated conductor, and only here you have a metallization exposed, exposed to the electrolyte, or exposed to the bottom of some cells, like your bottoms. It's all very elegant, and when the cell is firing an action potential, it's not me with an electrode trying to pinch or to get closer to the cell; here the cell is sitting on my electrode. And for instance, in this case, the cell sitting on top of this electrode, or maybe nearby, was, again, producing over a time scale of maybe a fraction of a second, producing a series of nerve impulses. Something that might be capturing your eye is that this impulse, it seems to be a negative deflection. Negative deflection makes me interested because it's a... Let's say some of them seem to be smaller in amplitude. So here, maybe, it's like having a microphone in the room. Let me actually see if this guy is still recording. Yeah. So it's like having a microphone and having two people talking simultaneously, but one guy is a little bit further apart. So there is attenuation; there might be some attenuation like sounds, or like charge, or like electrical potential. You know, there is some sort of attenuation with distance. One over the distance, one over the square of the distance. We are going to see it and discuss it or refresh it later today. But it's interesting that if I have one neuron here, and I have one electrode, so let me connect this electrode to an amplifier. Just because I want to impress you that I'm an electronic engineer, so I remember how to make amplifiers. That's all. We don't need electronics for the moment. It's interesting to see that this electrode is recording a signal that is like a negative deflection. So this is zero. It's probably zero microvolts. And this is probably minus 100 microvolts. So it's very, very tiny. You need a big amplifier to analyze it.

In solution, although we are going to discuss it, in solution you have, as you probably know, you have ions. And these ions can be positively and negatively charged. In the electrode, if this is made, say, this electrode is made of platinum and this cable here is made of copper, Cu is copper, right? Okay, so here you probably know that the charge carriers are electrons. Fine, okay, but it's interesting that here ions, say for instance you might have sodium ions and chloride ions, or you might have calcium. Okay, calcium will have double valency, but you might have positive and negative ions. Here the antenna is recording a signal that is negative. Why would it be negative? Well, why should this part of space be negative? Think of it. We are going to slowly approach this apparent mystery. It must be something about the distribution of charge inside and outside in general, and during when the neuron is excited and it emits a pulse. It's very interesting because it's the same language that you might have been seeing while studying semiconductors. In semiconductors, you have two charge carriers. One is the electron, and the other one, you know what it is? Have you ever studied silicon? *Lacune*. Holes. Yeah. So, it's not so different. You have positively and negatively charged carriers, and the analogies are many, so many, that even the pH, the acidity of a solution, that means if you have some proton, some H+, also because water is dissociated, so if you have H+, if you measure this, it's a measure of pH. There is some sort of equivalent in the semiconductor world. So the analogies... so at the beginning of last hour, because of the suggestion by your colleague, I mentioned that in terms of spatial scale, nanomaterials, nanotechnologies are even smaller, if not comparable, to biological processes. Well, it turns out we have even the electronics that is maybe speaking some language that we are used to.

I'm showing you this because even in this very simplified circuit, you have some sort of emerging behavior. Different spots here, different dots are from different electrodes. Here, here, and here we have 60 of these electrodes indicating when in time there is one of these peaks at that electrode. So, electrode number 1, number 2, number 3, number 60. And time is in this direction, and what you actually see here that seems to look like fireworks, is the top view of an 8x8 array of microelectrodes, similar to the one that you held in your hands last week. And when there is a small explosion, it's because there is a small signal, like this. And you see that just by eye, looking here, there are situations like now where the activity is irregular, asynchronous, and epochs in which the activity is almost synchronous everywhere. Oh, and there it seems as if it's not tired. There is not a lot of spontaneous activity now, then it started again. And here in this other representation, this synchronized activity is represented by stripes. What I found interesting is at this point, you probably noticed that immediately after, there is fatigue. It's as if things get tired, which is what I mentioned before, knocking and saying, if I ask this population to fire a lot of action potentials, a lot of nerve impulses, after a while they will get exhausted. So they might need a few milliseconds to recover, which is... this is one stupid example, but I hope it will stick. It's disgusting. If you have these animals, the llama, you know that llamas spit. If you ask the llama to spit repeatedly, say 20 spits per second, after a while the llama will not have any more saliva in its mouth, so it will not be able to spit. But if you give it time, it will replenish its reserves of saliva. Maybe here is the same thing, and citing Professor Zoli's classes, maybe in the synapse that maybe he has shown or maybe not, the vesicles containing neurotransmitters, maybe they got depleted. So all the neurotransmitter was released and they got empty. So even if you ask, "Okay, release, release,"... All the other comparisons with urinary functions and other things will not be very elegant, so I'm sticking with a llama spitting, although it's a stupid comparison.

So, the fact that you have a network in a dish is hinting at the fact that you could study, in a reduced preparation, signals and how the signals are organized when you have a circuit, which is very interesting, very convenient, besides what I mentioned last week, that you could maybe build some sort of biological computer by having neurons in a dish, not anymore in the brain of a living animal.

#### **Section 6: Macroscopic Signals: Electroencephalography (EEG)**

Instead of this microscopic recording with this microelectrode array, probably you're familiar with a more mesoscopic, macroscopic recording of the electrical activity, which I wanted to do, but in class I wanted to demonstrate but it's not really possible because of the noise. Later, I'll tell you why last time I had a lot of noise, but that's for another time. And this is called the electroencephalogram, and it's due to the observation from Hans Berger, that was from the last century, or the 19th century... well, the 20th century, in which by having an electrode, first he did it in a dog, in dogs, he had an electrode on the scalp, so very far from the actual brain. So not only you have hair, skin, bone, and then below you have membranes like the dura mater, the pia mater, so you have a lot of stuff before you start having neurons. But what he could observe is, this is one of the original traces, that you have electrical signals that are changing over time. So you probably are familiar with the EEG as a way to reveal rhythms. And what does it mean? Why? Okay, yeah, I get it that compared to what I did before or what Hubel and Wiesel did, they had one microphone and the microphone was in the mouth of one neuron, it was so close. And this is similar, more similar to somebody sitting outside the room. Okay, now you're very quiet and I'm grateful for this. But if we were all talking and chatting, some people, somebody from the outside of the room, will simply hear some rumble. They would not be able to distinguish individual voices, they will actually hear the summated effect. Maybe even attenuated because of the distance. Like neurons are attenuated because the electrode is a surface skin electrode. And because of a lot of noise. So, yeah, it's a very sloppy, very poorly characterized signal. But it might be worth understanding or trying to understand a little bit because this is what in diagnostics people use, for instance, to predict whether you have some disorder of excitability like epilepsy or whether you have some sleep disorder or whether you have some sort of connectivity disorder. Schizophrenia, autism, would maybe reveal their signature on EEG. So for understanding first principles, forget it, it's too broad. It's actually, I want to speak with each of you to understand what you're saying, but if you want to simply classify as healthy or diseased, go for it, because people accumulated more than 100 years of experience for understanding whether this is normal or this is pathological.

So this is electroencephalography and we will sort of slightly go around, I'll tell you what it is, and it's for what I consider to be more like a classification. So you put the electrodes, hopefully you put the electrodes always in the same position, because hopefully you want maybe to try to compare different patients, different experiments, different measurements from different doctors, different people, different hospitals, different countries. So you may want to have a convention, and it's purely a convention, there is nothing to understand. In fact, I'm not going to tell you about this convention. And it's what you end up with, what people did, was simply observing. Okay, so the guy is sleeping. Oh, the guy is keeping his or her eyes open. Or no, the person is with eyes closed. Or the person or the animal, the rat, or whatever, is running or is staying still. And they could see that in different brain states, which I don't know if they are really brain states, they are conditions that are easy to classify, to recognize behaviorally, because if I think about my childhood now, how can you really be sure that I'm thinking of my child? If I'm snoring and sleeping, maybe you can say, "Okay, the guy is sleeping." So you characterize, you classify, it's purely a categorization. There is no understanding, but you can annotate rhythms based on their frequency. So if it's slow, like... particularly today I was watching a YouTube video where beta and alpha apparently are enhanced by practitioners of mindfulness. If you sit and you focus on your breath, your frequency content or your waves in the cortex of the beta band or alpha band, that means in the frequency component of part of your spectrum of your EEG, beta and alpha are higher than when you are instead doing nothing, you are scrolling Instagram or TikTok. Instead, if you are engaged in sleep, then your activity slows down. It's sort of getting so-called theta rhythm, or even deep sleep with delta and even slower. And people now start a little bit to understand, okay, but at the level of individual nodes. So, one node, what does it do when it sleeps? Does it also oscillate four times per second? Does it fire one pulse once a second? And the answer is yes. But it's very peculiar because all the nodes in the cortex are roughly doing the same stuff. So somebody sitting outside, if we were all clapping our hands with a rhythm, they would probably be able to get at least the rhythm, if we are all synchronized. If we are... probably you have experience, when you go to a theater and you clap, you're not synchronized with your peers, unless the singer or whoever is asking you to do so, is imposing some pacemaking. And if there is randomness, from the outside, you will actually hear no rhythm, noise. If instead everybody is synchronized, then outside, so the EEG amplitude will record some sort of oscillation. So, yes, but they also need to be synchronous, like in vitro those stripes that I showed you in a dish, in a culture dish.

### **Part 5: Pathological Brain Activity: Epilepsy**

#### **Section 1: The Penfield Homunculus and Seizures**

Have you ever heard of the Penfield homunculus? Before the break, I would like to know whether you know what the sensory or motor homunculus is. Some of you are nodding. Just because in a moment I will discuss with you what happens when an EEG will actually see this, when the rhythms of the brain, so the signals that you can detect by EEG, they go completely crazy. They get synchronized, and when they get synchronized... Ah, I spoiled it. Okay. When they get synchronized, they get synchronized across in space. So they're actually invading the entire cortex. And the question is, this cortical homunculus, okay, I spoiled it, is where in the sensory area of the cortex—I think here is sensory and here is motor. Yeah. So, in different areas of the cortex, you have different spots, different surfaces of the cortex, devoted to different body parts. Both in terms of sensation, so tickling, or in terms of movement. And one question that I have for you before the break is: Do you know why hands are deformed? Or even the lips, both for the sensory and the motor, and the motor homunculus, which is a sort of graphical representation of what this mapping is. And Penfield is a neurosurgeon that was the first to, during surgery, neurosurgery, start stimulating the sensory cortex of an awake patient, and the patient was saying, "Yeah, you're touching me on my hand." "I know, I'm just electrically stimulating one part of your somatosensory cortex." Or, probably in an anesthetized patient, saying to the patient, "Why are you twitching your finger?" "I don't know, it's not me, it's not my voluntary control." "Yeah, don't worry, it's the neurosurgeon that is stimulating electrically with a small electrical pulse in the exact same area where your finger is mapped." So we have this map, and like for retinotopy, it's some sort of deformation. I would love if you could think of why hands are over-represented and also lips and tongue. 30 seconds, you have any idea? It's about evolution. Why? Why? Why? Sensory feedback, and we also have to have a very... not only piano players, but also us. We need to, in order to be dexterous, to be skilled with hands, with movements, we need to have big hardware. And the lips, I think, not for language, but because of food. So you want to know if it's very hot or if it's a scorpion. It's an interesting thing. I have to read if it's about... I don't think it's about... because in primates, non-speaking primates, you have the same. You have the same deformation. But it's definitely related to survival. So we'll stop for 10 minutes. And I'll change the microphone battery. Thank you. Which is what? But thank you. "computer vision e in generale in image processing esistono dei filtri, se avete fatto un corso di soluzione di reti neurali la parola 'convoluzione' vuol dire applicare un filtro lineare all'immagine. Quello che vi ho detto è per fare il detector di edge è applicare un filtro che sia una derivata spaziale in una certa direzione e nella direzione opposta e questo è un kernel. Questo kernel non lo so perché sono ignorante se se lo fanno lo fanno questo kernel, questo kernel è un filtro spaziale che è esattamente il circuito che avete implementato e molto probabilmente è il finale della..." (In computer vision and in general in image processing there are filters. If you have done a course on neural networks, the word 'convolution' means applying a linear filter to the image. What I told you to do to make an edge detector is to apply a filter that is a spatial derivative in a certain direction and in the opposite direction, and this is a kernel. I don't know, because I'm ignorant, if they do it, they do this kernel. This kernel is a spatial filter that is exactly the circuit that you have implemented and very probably it's the final part of the...) Thank you. I think this. And you can finish every 45 or... Okay, so other two blends of topics or contexts that I think might be relevant when you study electrophysiological signals, particularly pathological signals, particularly something that, as I said, electroencephalography would reveal as a pathological signal: ultra-synchronized transients known as epilepsy. And I will show you a couple of videos without omitting the so-called graphic part, the part that will be maybe disturbing to some of you. But I wanted to just evoke the story of the homunculus because maybe you already know that different spots of your sensory cortex or motor cortex are encoding for different areas in the world. Well, the world would be the skin or the motor action. So also in this case, by the way, you can talk about receptive fields. The receptive field would be an area on my skin that would be, if stimulated in some way, mechanically, thermally, with pain, then I would have neurons in the corresponding cortex activated by it. But what I wanted only to refresh is that you know that you have some parts that would be, if you have electrical activity here, maybe stimulated by an electrode or maybe by some crazy wave of synchronous activity that gets generated and it spreads pathologically out over the whole cortex, maybe invading here would give the impression that something is touching your leg, even if you don't have anything. And similarly, if you have activation, again, by an electrode, by somebody like Penfield stimulating like a neurosurgeon, or by a wave of synchronous pathological activity in your face, in the motor part of your face, maybe you will contract both, you will extend both muscles, and you will start having some motor actions that are clearly highly unphysiological. And from the behavioral point of view, would not be normal, would not be conventional, would not be something that you're used to. Because normally, say for some motor actions, you're contracting only one muscle and not both. You would contract the extensor or the contractor, but not both at the same time. Okay, you answered: "And if a wave of abnormal synchronous electrical activity..." further you understand that we could experience sensory sensations and even motor actions. And okay, the story about how it could propagate from one spot to the next... I kept drawing some axons and synapses and another neuron and a neuron with another axon, so it may not be completely impossible to understand that if the connection is for doing some computation, it is so intricate, and maybe just by chance as a side effect, it's a system that can be very easily recruited for propagating pathological electrical activity. This is a nice video that you probably have been, I hope you have been seeing some variations on, in which if you have a set of metronomes and you are having some way to couple them, not by, in this case, by electrical synapses, by connections, but some sort of reading that is propagating vibrations and effectively coupling them, after a while, the metronomes get synchronized. So if you have a system that is highly densely connected and something goes wrong, it could explode, because all the elements could get synchronized, unless you remove some sort of medium for connectivity, for the spread of activity, for connectivity. Anti-epileptic drugs either slow down the pacemaker, they make all the neurons fire a little bit less, or they try to interrupt connections. And clearly, I hope your objection will be: "Hey, wait a minute, the connections are there for me to talk, to understand, to reason, to love, to dream, so if you interfere chemically, maybe I will have side effects." And this is indeed the case. So maybe in a near future, there are already many clinical trials, you will not have anymore a pill that is indiscriminately shutting down all the neurons. You will have a small brain pacemaker that when a sudden abrupt rise of synchrony is occurring, will try to desynchronize, like in this case it would be... could be somebody, at some point, shaking this, so that the metronomes that got synchronized would not be anymore synchronous.

#### **Section 2: Epilepsy as a Disorder of Hypersynchrony**

So I'm talking about these abnormal rhythms and synchronization. They are relevant and typically very commonly described and measured by EEG, by electroencephalography. And it's interesting for me to just to mention, if you're not already familiar, epilepsy is a collection of many disorders that result in this sudden synchronized activity. So the seizure, *convulsione epilettica*, is just a symptom and not always can be treated by drugs. So one out of three people are drug-resistant, unfortunately. And this involves seizures, and I will show you a couple of types of seizures, which are sudden and excessive electrical discharges of the central nervous system neurons. And obviously because of the homunculus, of the Penfield homunculus, and not only that, because where is my sense of religion? Where is my sense? Where is my awareness? Where are my breath centers? It's not only in the cortex, but for the cortex and the homunculus it's easier to find. You have unexpected changes in behavior, in motor functions, in sensation and in consciousness. Whatever it is to be aware, to be conscious, to be able to receive information and react appropriately must be related to electrical activity. Unless you believe in the soul, but that's a different story. I don't. So if you have electrical activity that goes crazy, you might affect, not necessarily, but you could also affect consciousness. And it's quite frequent, 1% of the population. There is also a set of epilepsies that appear in the pediatric age, and they tend to disappear. So I'm not asking if, but it could be that some of you, as a kid, could have had one seizure. And because of traumatic injury, you could even experience, I hope not, but in the future, all of us could experience a seizure. Even in Alzheimer's, in dementia, there are seizures. There is some sort of excitability disorder. So a disorder of the electrical state of neurons.

So these seizures are typical events that last a few minutes, and if they don't persist too long, they do not cause persistent damage. For the moment, we would not understand why there should be persistent damage. You could maybe, by some analogy with electronics, you would say, if my computer would be electrocuted, so there would be some sudden electrical activity in all the parts of my laptop, probably it will be fried. Some component will be broken, mechanically or electrically. It will be burned. You don't have heat in the brain. You have glutamate, which is the excitatory neurotransmitter, which nobody really knows why this is the case, it's also cytotoxic. So it's toxic to the cell. Cytology is the study of the cell. So cytotoxic is something that would kill the cell. So if you have a lot of glutamate release, cells start to undergo cell death, apoptosis. And despite in the past, epilepsy was associated with stupidity, to witchcraft. People were burning, so people were burned alive because they were thought to be witches or wizards, just because of epilepsy, and there is no relationship to intelligence or to violence. There is still a societal stigma that if you, I hope that maybe you know somebody suffering from epilepsy, yeah, they're fine. And there are two kinds. I will show you an example of petit mal and grand mal. The petit mal, they are also called absence seizures. Well, this one I will not show you the video. And you will see in a moment why they are called absence, depending if it's French or not. Instead, the grand mal are more graphic to see and in both cases consciousness is compromised. There are other seizures that instead are not involving... consciousness is not compromised. This is a typical EEG plot, different electrodes placed as I told you conventionally in different places of the skull, they record very large, so large amplitude and also fast oscillations, which is interesting that they get large, while before they were not large. And the comparison, it was a stupid comparison of us clapping our hands, synchronously or not synchronously, and somebody from outside the door, doing some sort of average of the sounds, would actually hear very prominently the bang of us clapping if we are synchronous, and not really large, in that case it would be auditory sound pressure, very strong when we are not synchronous. It's the same phenomenon, and I have another cartoon to show to you, where here we don't have... we have asynchronous activity. Millions are oscillating, they are firing, but they are firing in a scrambled way. So there is no summation, no big build-up. If instead they do, and they do everything... There is probably cell number two that started going crazy before, and the others are maybe following. How would you know that? Maybe some signal processing technique, like cross-correlation. If you ever played with signal processing, it would maybe give you, it's a linear technique of course, it would give you some hints about how delayed one signal is to the other one. Cross-correlation means that you quantify similarity, and it could be similarity but not at the exact same moment, so isochronous, but with some phase shift. And indeed, you could reveal that, say, electrode number two is earlier, the signal from electrode number two starts earlier. But okay, just to give you a glimpse that what you studied, or at least what some of you studied in your previous years, is very useful. By the way, even trigonometry, but we'll see that another time.

So I'll show you now a focal, which means it's not generalized, it's not invading the entire cortex, it's only focal. And this young kid, you probably can guess where he has the focus of the epilepsy. The guy is without... he's contracting, moving the mouth, so you probably can tell me which part of the cortex in the Penfield homunculus this focus is located. At least you can tell me whether it's the motor or sensory cortex. This should be easy. Motor. So it's a motor symptom. And obviously it's likely to be related. It's around here. Not that necessarily it's always easy to say, "Ah, yeah, I see." And therefore you do it with EEG, showing where it is located. And in this case it doesn't spread everywhere. It's... you know, it's very easy to understand something, something that went wrong with the population of neurons that started to oscillate at the same frequency as the motor symptoms. And something interesting is that it's not in this case, it's not spreading, although there are connections. For instance, there are connections between the motor and sensory areas. It's not spreading, it's not invading, luckily for this guy, it's not invading the entire cortex. So in this case consciousness is not affected, it's unilateral, it's localized. Of course, it's unilateral, it's only in the left part of the face, in the motor areas, so in the cortex you have a representation of all motor and sensory areas of the body. And it's intermittent, and the fact that it's intermittent has something to do with neurons, and we will see later on when we discuss excitability. Why would a nerve cell be inherently starting to oscillate? Why is it an oscillator? And so this is clearly here, I'm not talking about one neuron, it's probably going to be millions of neurons nearby sitting here and being faulty for some reason. Maybe they got too hyper-connected. Maybe there is some fault in the genetics and when the neurons are firing, maybe some positive ions are accumulating too much and they are not able to diffuse away, like ink in a glass of water that would diffuse away. Maybe there is something wrong with, technically it's called ionic buffering, that means removing ions that are in excess, and this movement in the population starts to go crazy.

I'll show you now, it's quite... it's a little bit dramatic, but not as dramatic as a tonic-clonic seizure that I'm not showing to you, but if you're curious, have a look on YouTube. It's not... the person is not in pain during the seizure. Of course it looks to you as very unnatural. So it's not a surprise that people thought, "Oh, it's the devil that is possessing this person." But the consciousness of the person is gone. So clearly, if it's your brother, your boyfriend, it has an emotional impact, but the person is not suffering. So you could look at those videos on YouTube where people are showing them to say, "I'm not possessed by the devil, I'm not more violent, I'm suffering from a disorder of excitability." Here, it's typically the absence seizure. They are generalized, so consciousness is gone. It's happening several times a day, so they can be very disruptive for kids that are learning at school. They typically go away with puberty, so some sort of reorganization of the cortex and the thalamus is happening with age. This is known, so we know that the development of the nervous system in humans is continuing during adolescence, and I think up to 18, 20 years of age. And if you record the EEG, it's not this very strong, high-amplitude, ultra-synchronized, crazy EEG; it has a very peculiar peak that is called a spike, although it's not a spike like in an action potential in a nerve impulse, it's visually a peak and a wave. So it's a small needle and then a wave. Needle-wave, spike-wave, spike-wave at a very specific frequency, 3 hertz. When a neurologist, an expert in reading EEG, looks at this, they immediately say, "The thalamus is involved and this is an absence seizure." The thalamus, as I said, is the station that is in between, that is connecting sensory information and relaying it to the cortex. So you could probably understand that maybe the connections are not only in one direction; there is feedback, like everywhere in the brain, there is almost always feedback. So you have basically a station that is, just by some pathological state... If some focal epilepsy starts here, it can be recruited and it can spread the activity everywhere. Okay, the point is not relevant. It's only that the father is calling him again and again. In a moment it starts and he's blanking. He's not there anymore. Here it starts. And he does not have any memory, any recollection of what's happening. For him, time was moved forward by a few seconds. Now it's back. Imagine if you're at school, and now it starts again. Even with your accent... "did she send me the whole thing when I was absent?" The twitching of the eyes is also another interesting thing. It's gone. So this is quite dramatic and some of you told me about your interest in consciousness. Well, it seems that the thalamus and the fact that the cortex is not completely synchronized and the thalamus is remaining as a relay station for sensory information and it's not going crazy like in this case, seems to be relevant. So here consciousness is gone and it's like a switch: on-off, on-off. So I don't know what consciousness is, nobody knows it. Only a little bit we start understanding it, and the route of looking at pathologies like coma, locked-in syndrome or anesthesia or some forms of epilepsy are relevant for objective information, also with the idea of treating, for therapy, of course, patients.

So this is an example of a generalized seizure. Again, it starts in one specific area. I really don't care about the positioning of the electrodes. As I said, this is a convention. You can learn it, and maybe after a couple of weeks you will forget it. Knowing that it's a convention might give you some hints that we don't really know. We know that if we do this always in the same way, we can compare it to the literature and to books, which is precious. So an experienced neurologist would say that this was a sort of event that looked funny, and this is the start of the seizure. What happens normally, and you will probably understand why, after having been confronted with the fact that you have the Penfield homunculus somewhere, and also that the brain is responsible for cognition, thoughts, emotions, memory, dreams, hopes, etc., smell, etc., it's all in the electrical activity of the cells. You can probably understand that at this stage, a few tenths of seconds, a few seconds before the loss of consciousness, patients are reporting the so-called aura. And typically they start responding, saying, "Okay, something is wrong. I start smelling something that is funny, that it's not real, it's not authentic, it's not real." It's clearly not real. Let's say there is nothing in the world that smells. And there are signals that are normally not compatible with actual sensory things because the world smells differently. If my olfactory cortex is activating synchronously, it starts to get activated in a synchronous way, maybe this does not correlate to any chocolate, any Belgian chocolate, but not even any food. Or I will start to feel, to have visual hallucinations. Again, we know that in the visual cortex you have cells that start to be activated if you have, in the world, light stimuli with orientation. So there is no surprise that maybe sometimes you can see a geometrical pattern. There is a nice book by... Ah, damn. He's a very famous neurologist. He died a few years ago. He was the author of *Awakenings*. It was a famous movie with Robin Williams. And he was reporting about hallucinations. In his case, because he was blind, but in general about geometrical shapes. Can you help me? Do you know the guy? No, you should read him. He's a very famous... I think he won the Pulitzer Prize for the book. So he was a scientist, a medical doctor, but he was also a very talented writer. Oliver Sacks. Oliver Sacks. Thank you. Thanks. Please believe me, he's a fantastic guy. Very humble, and he died recently. So, no surprise that you could see during the aura this, and report geometrical patterns. Now we know that you have cells that are encoding for orientations, etc.

At some point you have the tonic stage in which the motor cortex is invaded by... so consciousness is gone because you are, anyway, all the cortex is doing the same thing. And it's not a big surprise that people are reported, if you look at the movies, at the videos on YouTube, people obviously fall on the ground, this is the risk of injury, particularly if they are driving a car or flying a plane, these are the risks. Not necessarily the seizure per se, unless it happens very frequently. So there is a co-contraction of all the muscles and it starts progressively and clearly it doesn't look real, it doesn't look normal, and of course it's not normal. And something that was always capturing my attention is the so-called epileptic cry. If all muscles are contracted, it's also the muscles of the chest for respiration. So if I have air in my lungs, it gets extruded and if my epiglottis is closed, I will have some sort of sound. And of course, people around will get impressed, but technically it's just the muscles that are all contracting, because the entire motor cortex is invaded by this synchronized activity. And then after this tonic phase, it starts the clonic phase, so some sort of rhythm that is activating muscles, all the actuators, so extensors and contractors, all the pairs of muscles that are allowing movements, start to oscillate. And so the patient is typically at the beginning after a tonic phase, has a clonic phase. Many videos of dogs, epileptic dogs, are on the internet, unfortunately. And you would be surprised that epilepsy or neurological disorders in animals are in general advancing, even psychiatric disorders, depression, schizophrenia, are advancing our knowledge on the same diseases in humans. And as a side effect, treatments for the animals are getting better and better. This was sort of inspiring. And here we have, again, that maybe it starts with a focus, maybe it involves the thalamus as a way to relay pathological activity everywhere. And so this is sort of... so it can start, okay, I should have said, it could start in the thalamus and spread, or it can start somewhere and involve the thalamus and spread everywhere. This is probably the future in which either a subdural, sub, below the dura, the dura mater, or intracortically... so, ah, sorry, we're done. Or DBS, this is a DBS array of microelectrodes, this is a surface subdural, they could be maybe wireless, but wireless is not, okay, it's striking, it's cool, but it's not particularly mind-blowing. The mind-blowing thing would be that if you have a brain pacemaker that is able to interfere, maybe you can disrupt synchronization. With a big electrical pulse, you would scramble things. It would be as if you start making a mess, you start talking. You're too polite, too gentle and too silent, so it doesn't happen. If I start shouting, maybe you will get, for a moment, you will get shocked by my reaction. So if there are neurons, maybe I can shock them and they respond and later on they will be tired. For a few milliseconds, I showed you, real neurons are getting tired, they are adapting, so maybe I can desynchronize a population of neurons going crazy by giving them a sort of reset signal. And there are some of these devices in clinical trials, they are not yet on the market.

### **Part 6: The Biophysical Origins of Neural Signals**

#### **Section 1: The Origin of the EEG Signal**

Now, what is the origin of EEG? We are getting a little bit closer during the course, particularly during the second half of the course, but roughly I can tell you that the EEG, already now at the level of this cartoon, is related to the activity of one kind of cell, those that are my favorites, the pyramidal cells. Rita Levi-Montalcini, in her memories, was saying that on the microscope, looking at different brain sections, so, resected brain slices of maybe humans or chickens or rats, whatever, she was impressed by looking at all of them within the cortex. And this is actually quite impressive. No matter how many times you do the experiments, you do the preparation, the cortex looks always the same with all the pyramidal cells aligned like this. So, this is where the hairs are. And this is where the white matter is in the ventral part. Here is the dorsal part: the hair, the bone, the dura mater, and the pia mater. So they are all aligned in this way. She actually said that they resembled pilgrims walking along lines during a pilgrimage. Okay, it stuck in my brain and I wanted to tell you. And it's because these guys are aligned, they are aligned as electrical dipoles. Maybe you're familiar with magnetic dipoles, north and south. Sort of the same thing, although it's not magnetic forces or magnetic phenomena here. Maybe under some circumstances that we will see, the soma will get charged, say, positively. I'm talking about outside. And the dendrites will be charged negatively. And so this separation of charge will act as a dipole, and because they are all aligned in the same way, all the electric fields, vector fields, will summate. And if you have an electrode here, you will sense it.

If you are like me, you probably got extremely disappointed, saying, "Okay, yes, these cells represent the majority of the cells in the cortex. But the brain is not only the cortex. What about the thalamus? What about the basal ganglia? What about the base of the encephalon? The cerebellum. Who cares about the cortex?" Yes, it's probably evolutionarily the most interesting part. It's probably why we are human, because of our cortex... But come on, the EEG is only about one spot of the brain? Not only the surface, only 80% of cells, all the cells that have this geometry. What about all the other cells? There are many other cells that are also excitatory, and there are many inhibitory cells, which are here, and they are all making a very dense network. They don't count, they don't play any role for the EEG, because their geometry is not aligned, and their electric fields cancel out. Which to me is depressing, because it says, "Okay, so EEG may give you some information, but it's not the golden standard." On the other hand, this is the only thing that we have. Unless you go invasive, but ethically, unless you need to have some sort of implant, you cannot look at the brain invasively. Functional magnetic resonance has a very sloppy temporal resolution, and spatially, you don't really see the electrical activity; you see the blood oxygenation level, which is indirect. It's metabolic, it's delayed, and it's averaged, and it may have nothing to do with the neurons. So we will try to understand not the entire EEG, but at least how the so-called extracellular fields can be studied, given the morphology of a cell, and what happens for the cell to have here positively charged ions outside and far apart from the apical dendrite, negatively charged ions. This is where we can start understanding, and we will call this local electrical phenomenon, we will call it local electric field, or local field electrical potential, local field potential, LFP, instead of EEG which clearly involves a mess of the entire block of cortex that is below it. You probably know that the cortex, particularly the human cortex, is not flat. It's constantly a sequence of gyri and sulci. It's not flat. The cortex of a rabbit is flat. The cortex of a human, probably because we had such a large growing surface extended, has to be packed and folded. Like a piece of paper, I do it for the sake of science, like a piece of paper in order to have the same surface but occupying a smaller volume. Whoever will forgive me.

So this is a cartoon that I promised for only this cell. Okay, I'm basically neglecting all the other interesting interneurons, inhibitory neurons and other excitatory neurons that are not shaped like this for dipoles. And here you probably understand why roughly the same activity... So this is very stylized. You don't see any pulse, like I told you the neurons are emitting those pulses. But if you allow this poetic license, then here you have that this activity is very different from neuron number one to neuron number two to neuron number three. So if you do the arithmetic average, the sum, you have the EEG on a first approximation, and you see that maybe you have, as a result, a small amplitude, high frequency signal. Small amplitude because it's never one transient... okay, here this is one big transient, but the other big transient for the other cell starts not in the same spot, it starts here, and this one has it here, and this one has it here. So they're not synchronous, so they don't sum up. So, amplitudes are small and they are at high frequency just purely as a result of this arithmetic summation. Not because the individual cells were firing or were oscillating at high frequency. Simply because of phase differences. And when they are synchronized, you actually see it and you have large amplitude, slow frequencies. These words of "large amplitude, slow EEG" or "desynchronized EEG, small amplitudes, fast frequencies" are what neurologists talk about all the time, because this is sort of their stereotypical language that they use qualitatively to refer to maybe some state, or learning state, that we don't understand. We understand partly why this happens and how it can be treated, if they're really synchronous or not synchronous.

#### **Section 2: The Need for a Deeper Understanding**

I'm done with this long introduction, calling for bioengineering and neuroengineering to actually develop an understanding. So it's not that we want to, for the sake of science, understand the origin of the EEG and understand what happens or why, in this case it was a microscopic EEG, why you get a negative signal and then you get maybe a small positive bump. Why? I want to do that because if I understand slightly what happens, maybe I can design that brain pacemaker to interfere with epilepsy better, or I can have some brain-machine interface based on EEG, like most of the brain-computer interfaces nowadays, for people that do not have any invasive implant, work better. Today they are not suboptimal. However, it's a mess to understand, and it's not just the algebraic sum. So it's more than this, and it's very complicated because these cells are electrical devices. So the local field potential, that is what we are going to investigate a little bit. EEG and even the magnetic counterpart, MEG, are involved, and they are still not completely understood. This is a computer simulation of one guy and we are going to use... So this is from one of the authors of the book that I recommended for this course. And right now in the simulation he is activating only the soma. And the neuron here becomes red and the EEG, the simulated EEG or local field potential, shows a positive deflection. Let me see again. So, when you only have inputs arriving in the basal dendrites, then the local field potential starts to be positive, depending on which depth your electrode is at. If the inputs are arriving in the periphery, in the apical dendrites, you actually see it's the exact opposite. And if the input arrives everywhere, in a moment, for the simulation, the cells will start firing and communicating and getting bright, whatever. You almost record nothing. So, the naive expectation that on the surface, with this simulated output, whenever you see a positive bump, it means that you have one or the other activation, is wrong. It depends on the activation, what caused the activation, and where the synaptic inputs impinged and activated the compartments. Now it doesn't make sense, I only want to show it so that we can understand a little bit better. And the way to understand it involves understanding, first of all, that neurons are not points; they are not systems that are concentrated in one point, although the point-neuron approximation is useful and we will use it. So neurons are distributed in space, like maybe a small cable and a ball, which is the soma. I'm particularly using the word "cable" because I'm a geek and I told you about my interest for Morse code. In the late 19th century, Lord Kelvin, the same guy famous for thermodynamics, wrote a mathematical equation for submarine electrical cables, bringing telegraphic signals, Morse code signals, under the ocean, because they were difficult to design or difficult to understand the variations of signals that are propagating through such long cables. Believe it or not, the exact same equation, the cable equation, will be used in this course to try to make sense of this local field potential. And it's surprising that it's the same equation as for an electrical cable. In this case, it's a biological cable. So the key point is, it's not a point, it's distributed in space, and it matters where and how the electrical activity of these cells is behaving. Right now it doesn't make sense.

#### **Section 3: Biophysical and Mathematical Preliminaries**

I'm going now to start with light preliminaries. So we'll finish in five minutes and then we have the last hour. It's going to be light. I'm going to refresh some concepts from electrostatics and biophysics. Do you have questions so far? I invite you once more, if you have any questions, to come to me, to contact me. I don't care about repeating things over and over for you or giving you additional explanations of material. If you don't speak, I cannot deal with it. So my suggestion would be to start studying about these topics throughout the course. You don't necessarily need to do the exam in the first session in January, but do it. Because you have me engaged and active. Not that I go away in the second semester, I'm still here in Modena. But maybe we can refer and count on these, maybe it will work or will not, on the Teams chat that you could use as a forum to ask questions. And maybe some of your community will say, "I found this analogy useful." The one of the llama spitting was disgusting and was not very useful. But these other analogies helped me understand it. So please, count on me.

So let me switch to preliminaries and then we'll break. And for this part the slides are already in the repository; I posted them this morning. You could refer if you want to these two chapters in this book, particularly *Cellular Biophysics* and *Foundations of Cellular Neurophysiology*. I don't know whether all these books are... at least I know that this should be in the library, this one should also be in the library. If not, let me know and I'll ask them to buy it. And for no reason, look at... well, you could even consider buying some of these books. The idea is that they are supporting your studying and understanding. It's not necessarily that you will see here verbatim, word by word, what I'm saying. I try to make your life even simpler, even taking it and refreshing something that you probably already studied extensively in high school or during the first couple of years of your bachelor, at least the first year of bachelor in physics. And there are these four concepts. The first one is purely a convention, and I would like to... it's a nomenclature thing, and I would like to make, because, sorry, explaining it will give me the possibility to clarify some concepts. So, physicists normally always talk about the density of particles in space. Chemists talk about concentrations of a solute in a solvent. It's the same thing, it's a matter of jargon, and I will demonstrate it to you. Second, I would like to, since we have to talk about electrical potential and charges, I have maybe to refresh basic electrostatics. So it's not Maxwell's equations, eh? Don't worry. It's maybe Coulomb's force and what is the potential of a force? What is the electrostatic potential? Third is something that you may or may not have heard of. It's mobility. I need to describe the ions that we will start looking at. I need to understand and to give a number to possibly measure if a fat ion swimming in a solution in the aqueous medium will encounter more resistance than a slim ion. I would like to give a number. This number I call it mobility, which is not particularly original. So the mobility of a particle in a fluid, in an aqueous solution. And fourth, again, this is another definition in the sense that it's me defining what I would love to describe. It's a flux or flow of particles in a fluid. Particularly because I want to understand whether maybe ions are going inside or outside or they go away. How do they work? How does it work? Because so far, particularly for electromagnetism, I know about forces. Okay, you have a particle, and maybe you are in an electric field, I know what force it is. But I want to understand how these things move. And to do that, it's very convenient to talk about flux. Flux is the biochemist's word for current. Those are going to be electrical currents. Well, strictly speaking, it's a current density, because it's per unit of area, per unit of cross-section. I imagine a river where you have water flowing, but this is nothing else than current. So electrical current, ionic current, this is resistance, electrical resistance, but I call it mobility, and all the rest are definitions or fundamental laws of nature.

And I'm going to use mathematics, like it or not. Okay, Feynman was even saying that it allows us to reason. So it's not only a language that is very precise, but per se allows us to make inferences, allows us to make discoveries. And it's true, if I can write something in mathematical terms, maybe I can then shut down my brain, shut down my understanding, and simply crunch equations, and I will derive consequences. And of course, then I go back to the experiment to see whether it works. Of course, I'm not claiming that you will have to remove your intuition. All my efforts, today and in the coming weeks, is to try to tickle both your mathematical preferences as well as your physical intuition. I hope that you will roughly feel that you understand in your stomach, and you can replicate it with a pen and paper on the blackboard with chalk. And okay, so this is a sentence that I already told you. Nature speaks the language of math, and it's beautiful. It's a beautiful language, so maybe we can try to use the same language. This guy was a Nobel Prize winner for quantum mechanics, was a very prolific author of books, of science dissemination books. Maybe you know this guy; he was playing bongos and was also very fond of opening locks or *casseforti e lucchetti*. I mean, these people are a bit original. But he was really a genius. I think he was the guy who is considered to have invented nanotechnologies, because in the 80s he gave some remarks in one famous seminar talk that he gave at Caltech where he was working, talking about the opportunities of nanotechnologies, when technology starts to build devices that are small, nanoscale small. So I will stop now for 10 minutes and in a few slides I'll use the symbol "remember" to tell you "this you have to remember." And I'll just only give you this so that you are scared. So I will ask you informally to remember or to learn for the first time the plot, the graph of three functions, because, say four functions. One over r, which is what people call a hyperbolic function. Okay, it's one over r. This one is the famous exponential transient. Okay, so there is one minus... Okay. And this is the natural logarithm. And this is a linear term, it's a straight line. So you should be able, roughly, it's not that I'll ask you, "Here's millimeter paper," no, but roughly you should be able to plot these functions. Now that you're scared, we'll take a break for 10 minutes. I hope that you're not scared, but if you're scared, please come to me for mathematics. Thanks. Thank you. "ho caricato il giorno stesso però" (but I uploaded it the same day). I will be able to find the video that I have told you that I will find the description. What I've done is to make the description with Whisper and then put it into the... Thank you. Thank you. *pain* Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

I'm sure that inadvertently, the other time I started at 14:00 and today it was the same. In theory, I would end at 18:45, so I have to put an eye on it for a little less than 50 minutes. If not, it doesn't make sense. If not, I'll start first and finish at 18:00. But it won't happen. Ok, so I understand that you are tired and I hope that the... I hope to make it... I'm interrupting often, I'm just giving you videos and questions to make it a little bit more lively. Please speak if you are too bored or if you feel from now on that the style of the class is getting too hard. Not today, in general. So I know that you are tired, but these are very simple functions. And so I'm not asking you to do the so-called study of the function, say 1 over r. The limit as a function of r. And I'm not asking you to take the limit for r that goes to plus infinity, or r that goes to minus infinity, or to calculate the derivative or the second derivative. These are functions that just roughly by eye you should be able to do. So this is not a course in advanced calculus, it's not a course in mathematics. So it's a rough understanding of these functions. So any idea about who is somebody willing to help me plotting f(r) = 1 / r? You will have it on the slides, but if you want to challenge yourself, let me know what should I sketch. Okay, okay. So your colleague was making a sort of gentle curve, and indeed this is what I have in my head. Okay, maybe for negative r, but okay, negative maybe we will not care, because we are thinking of r as maybe a distance and the distance is only positive, but it is indeed the case. And again, you see, r is in the denominator, so when r gets very large, 1/r is getting squashed, it goes to 0. Yeah, okay, a mathematician would say it goes to 0+. Fine, okay, it will go to 0 from this part of the plane. And for r that goes to 0 from the right, it goes to plus infinity, because 1/r is something that grows over and over. So I'm not a mathematician myself, but roughly knowing that you have this profile is very convenient and useful.

The other one is only present for the charge or discharge of capacitors. So it's not because I'm in love with exponentials. They are nice, but I'm not... I'm in love with other things, not necessarily exponentials. So, and the way I would, it's f(r), what is it? It's f(r) = 1 - e^(-αr). The way that I still teach it to myself is looking at the exponent, assuming that alpha is a number, it's given, it's a positive number. You know that if you want to make me happy, the overall exponent of the exponential needs to be negative. Because if it's positive, you probably know that the exponential is exploding. And in biology, biophysics, I hope that nothing is exploding, particularly because I'm invoking the fact that the property that all physical systems should be dissipative. They should basically dissipate energy, so it's unlikely that things will go to plus infinity. Okay? So, if that f(r) is the value of the membrane potential across, so inside with respect to outside of a neuron, I don't expect it to explode, to go to plus infinity. It's starting to go to the other extreme where the exponential is... So, for r that goes to plus infinity, e to the minus... it goes to e to the minus infinity, so it goes to zero. So, you want to make me happy, check the exponentials, and this is also going to be relevant for differential equations. So, in that case, I know that the exponential, for r going in this direction... at some point, I will not have the exponential anymore. And as engineers do, a friend of mine made it very clear, saying engineering is not math, it is the science of approximation. So I would like to approximate things, and here I can see that it's the sum of two things. So even the graph, the plot, will be the superposition of two things. One that is always there, and the other one that at some point is not there anymore. So if at some point, yeah, ideally it's going to be at plus infinity, but in reality it's going to be on the order of 1/alpha, that is setting the scale of this equation. So here I only remain with 1. Because if r is so large, this can be neglected. If you want, you can do things properly, but yeah, I can see two pieces. And other things that I normally do, I test what happens when I put the argument of the exponent to zero. I do it because it's something that I always remember, what is the exponential of zero, that you all know is one. So if it's one, one minus one is zero. So, yeah, I should look for the concavity, but it's an exponential. So I know that it doesn't change. So the only thing that changes with r is this term here. And I know that it's something, it's an arch, that is either exploding or attenuating, going to dissipating, going to zero. So it's likely only going like this.

The logarithm, I think you know it or you don't. Logarithm of r. I'm on purpose using r instead of x, instead of t. So it may be that it annoys you a little bit, but it's purely just a variable name. So, fine, call it the way you want. It's purely a label. What is important is that I understand what is the independent variable, that is r. And you probably know that the logarithm, at least for real values, is not defined when the argument is negative. So the logarithm is the value that you have to give to the base, so it's an exponent that you have to apply to the base, that is e, in order to get the argument. It's the inverse operation of an exponential, and for an argument that is negative, it's not defined. You know, it's only one thing that you have to remember. And the graph of the logarithm is crossing this axis in one specific point. That is easy to remember. Do you know when, in other words, I'm actually searching for the value that makes... So where the logarithm is zero. So what is... One of my questions. So its value is one, am I right? So why it does not work... so I wanted to say what is the exponent that I have to give to the base e in order to have 0? It doesn't work, e to the 1 is 2.7 blah blah. Where is the problem? I have to think about it. But the plot is correct. I have to think about it. Again, it's not a course in math, and I will try to solve my own puzzle another time. And here for the straight line, you have one thing that is very important, is the angular coefficient, m. It tells you about the slope of the line, and then you have another value, p, that tells you where it crosses the axis. I don't remember it by heart. I simply say, "Okay, what happens if r is 0?" So r=0 means this axis here. So when r is 0, this term disappears. f needs to be p. So this is the value where the straight line is crossing the vertical axis. So these are crucial that you understand, that you remember that you are able to handle and to master roughly for the plots, for the graphs of these functions.

And another thing is the derivatives. So we're not talking about, well, we are also talking about integrals, but these are the derivatives that I would love you to refresh and remember. You know that the derivative of a constant, any constant, is zero, and 1/x is another one that, yeah, you could derive it from the incremental ratio, but do you remember what 1/x is? It's important because it comes in Coulomb's force, in the gravitational force you always have 1/r or 1/r^2, so this is somehow a polynomial with a negative exponent that is very important. No, I'm not asking for the integral, I'm asking for the derivative. So, in principle, you should write it as x to the power of -1 and then apply the rule. But it's, or vice versa, it's the ratio, say numerator and denominator, and you say it's the derivative of the numerator, which is 0, times the denominator, minus the derivative of the denominator multiplied by the numerator. So, it's 1, and because of that minus, and then you have here that you get x squared. So it's -1/x^2. You have time to refresh it. The derivative of the log is indeed 1/x, particularly if it's only if the log is a natural log. And then there is also this property that is very important, which is to say that the derivative is a linear operator. So if you have the derivative of a sum or of a subtraction, of a difference, what is the derivative? Yeah, and would it be the same? If here I would put some coefficients, 25 and -30, how would it change? Linear, ok, you know everything. So it's linear. And the other thing that we are going to use is the derivative of a composite function, for instance in this case the derivative of the log of c(x). It's a chain rule. I don't remember how it is called in Italian. *La regola delle funzioni composte*, but I don't remember if it's called the chain rule, it seems not. *C'erano i carabinieri un tempo, c'era la regola dei carabinieri, ma era un'altra cosa.* (There were the carabinieri once, there was the carabinieri rule, but that was something else.) Do you remember how this is... what you have to do here when you have a composite function? You take the derivative of the external one, and then you multiply it times the derivative of the argument. So in this case, it will be 1 over c(x) multiplied by the derivative of c. Let me know if it... Okay, I could have had them appearing slowly, slowly. Okay, and this is the only thing that we are going to use. Even written like this. The derivative of the log of C, that would be the concentration. And it's very important, because this also gives rise to some relationship with Einstein, which he is remembered for. It's about diffusion. It comes from that simple trick.

And I think the other thing is the concept of integrals. When you have the limits of integration, you invoke... So you know that integration is the inverse operation of the derivative, and the indefinite integral is basically... You could also call it an anti-derivative. And so, when you have the limits of integration, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, you actually have the primitive, and you calculate the primitive at one limit, minus the primitive calculated at the other limit. Does it ring any bell? And now, because this one is a log, and again, we are going to see exactly this integral later on, probably not today. Let me put it back, I'll keep speaking up until 7, and you may not like it. So here we are going to have exactly the log, and it's a difference of logs, and you know that because of the properties of logarithms, if you have a difference of logarithms with the same base, the result is the logarithm, yeah, yeah, it's the log of the ratio. So this is going to be omnipresent. So this you will get acquainted with. And another thing that we may... so this is not crucial because we are only using... I want to give you an intuition of the electric field in terms of the gravitational field and I want to use the Taylor expansion up to the first order. So a polynomial expansion up to the first order where I know that any function, any continuous and differentiable function, I can write it as the value around one point, so this is a number, this is like 27. So around 27, if h is very small I can approximate the function as the value of the function at that point plus basically a straight line, and this is the angular coefficient which is given by the derivative calculated at that point. It's the slope of the tangent to the function at that point. But this is not really crucial. We're not going to be... There is another way, another point in the next, probably next week, where we are looking at, maybe two weeks where we are using Taylor expansions, but maybe I'm not doing it. I'm only telling you that if you want, you can try.

And first of all, the differential equation, I tried to introduce this sign already last week. This is the only differential equation that I would love you to remember or to learn to solve. And again, you have this online refreshing video that, although it's my voice, it's a little bit monotonic and it's a bit boring, but I refresh different techniques, particularly when the equation is non-homogeneous. So when you do add some term here, and this term, say, for instance, is a constant. So if I read it aloud, this is a differential equation, meaning that the solution is not a number, so it's not an algebraic equation. The solution is a function, and it's a function such that when I take its derivative, I get the function itself. Okay, multiplied by some term, which is a constant, which is a number, a parameter. Okay, plus b, that's a little bit more involved. You need to be able to calculate the so-called particular integral. Or you do some heuristics. And the heuristic is that clearly the solution of the homogeneous equation associated with this ordinary differential equation is an exponential. Actually, it's a family of solutions. It's an infinite family of solutions. So this k is the one that you will fix by the initial condition. And here you claim that because here the right side, so this forcing term, depending if you're an engineer, you see this immediately as a linear system. So if this is the input to this equation, if this has the plus of being constant, then the solution must be of the same type, must be some constant. Now here I gave already the solution, but I should have called it big K. Something to identify, particularly by replacing this big K here and saying, "Okay, the derivative of a constant is zero minus A times big K plus B equals to zero." I can determine what K, big K, is. And we will not do anything more than this. You know that if B is instead a trigonometric function, then the solution is also of the kind of trigonometric functions. Actually, I think this is more general, and people were calling them *cisoidi*, *le funzioni cisoidali*. It means that you have trigonometric functions also pre-multiplied by an exponential, but we will not see that. And I remind you that if this b should be an arbitrary function, then the only way out is the convolution integral, which is maybe something that I... No, I did not, and I will probably only mention it once in the forthcoming classes. It's a filtering operator in the end, so this thing, this particular thing, as written like this, it's a low-pass filter. And, yeah, you need to remember that these exponentials are going everywhere, and that's why 1 - e^(-αr), or times x, or t... And you see that you will always see me being very worried when writing a differential equation, that here, the same state variable, F, appears here with a minus sign. If it's not a minus sign, then I get stressed because it's not a dissipative system and it can... it's exploding, and yada, yada. So I hope that with these stupid things, something will stick or will be refreshed in your brain.

Another thing that I will use is the orders of magnitude, particularly this giga, mega, kilo, so it's 1 billion, so 10 to the plus 9, sorry, 10 to the 9, 10 to the 6, 10 to the 3, and again, I will basically use milli, micro, nano, pico, and I remember, because milli is 3, I always go like this, I don't remember, so if you tell me pico, okay, maybe now I know that it's minus 12, but I do, so milli is 3, micro is 6, nano is 9 and pico is what follows nano. I cannot remember things by heart. There are of course exceptions because they are not in the MKS system, like the decimeter or centimeter. Fine, I remember that it's 10^-1 or 10^-2. This will become interesting because I will constantly push you to check your damn physical units. You have one way to check whether you are correct if you can check and test the measuring units. If you are summing at some point apples and pears, something is wrong. And if at some point in a differential equation like this, you have that B does not have the units of something, say that instead of being x it's time, it's a differential equation with time being the independent variable, B needs to be something per unit of time, because on the left-hand side you have something divided by time. And so the units here need to agree. So you will see me obsessing with these things, which is just an easy way to spot possible problems. Something that I remember that maybe is familiar for those of you who like beers and who've been to Germany, where you get in these beer gardens, where you have, particularly in summer, it's fantastic, they actually bring you a glass that is one liter of beer. And I cannot drink, although German beer is good, I was used to Belgian beers, and with Belgian beers you don't drink one liter. Only to say that you have something that you can keep in your hand that is one liter. Because this conversion... that is... if all... both liters and cubic decimeters are all volume indicators, they are all measuring units for volumes, it's only that liters are something that is more familiar to chemists, that basically had to deal with liquids, and they got used to this unit. Engineers and physicists, maybe they got used to something that was measured with a measuring tape, and they use meters and multiples and submultiples. But, yeah, they are the same. And I kept forgetting, but it's one cubic decimeter because it's something that you hold, 10 centimeters cubed, you can hold it in your hand, and it's beer in Germany. I don't know whether this will help or not.

#### **Section 4: The Resting Membrane Potential**

So why are we bothering with this concentration and density, mobility, electrical potential, and what was the other one, the flow, the flux? Because we have some investigative task for the couple of weeks that await us, that are the next two weeks. And it's, why if I take any cell, let me draw a cell, a neuron that gives me comfort. So I have one cell, and it's in any cell of your body, unless you are dead, and I will tell you why you could be dead, you have that conventionally, I'm referring, I'm taking the convention that is referring the electrical potential inside with respect to the outside. So outside is what I call conventionally, because potentials are defined with respect to a constant, an arbitrary constant, and I will refresh why there is this constant, why it is arbitrary, that I call it zero. So here it's zero millivolts. Inside your cell, all the cells of your body, there is an electrical potential that is non-zero, and it's negative. And for neurons, it's around minus 70 millivolts. There are different cell types in which you have minus 80 millivolts, minus 20 millivolts, and minus 70 millivolts is quite a lot compared to 3.3 volts of electronics or even smaller values of electrical potentials in microcircuits, microchips, is even a fraction. So it's a lot. Why is it minus 70 millivolts? I want to understand why it's negative and why it is minus 70. The reason why it's there is because you are not at thermodynamic equilibrium. Lucky for you and lucky for me, we are not yet dead. And being dead means that there is nothing, no more, at least maybe transiently there is, but when you are really dead, there is no difference between you and the environment. There is no energy spent to oppose entropy. You are as disordered as the environment. What there is in the environment is inside yourself. And if you are a cell, basically the membrane is rupturing, or at some point, things start to flow in and out, and you have identical things inside and outside. You are nature, you are completely embracing nature, you are dead. But if you are not dead, if you are eating bananas and chocolate, etc., you have disorder, sorry, you oppose disorder, you create order by spending energy, and you create some sort, apparently, of unequal ionic distribution inside and outside the cell. That's the whole story, but I would like to understand why. The reason is not that I'm obsessed, it is because if we understand why, we can make sense of why not, and why sometimes this electrical potential might change over time. If I know the mechanism, I can understand if things are changing over time, whether the mechanisms could change over time as well.

This is one example that I showed you. I don't know if I anticipated that I would have shown some neurons. So this is an experiment that we did many years ago. Just a cell from the cortex of a rat that we explanted the brain and we cut the brain in slices very quickly so that the tissue was not dying. It was actually still alive. And we put it under the stage of a microscope that we used. This is called a transmission microscope because light is going through, it's transmitted through the sample. And we are using infrared light because infrared light increases contrast. After all, cells, you know, are water, made of water, and they are surrounded by water, so there is no contrast. If you see them with a normal microscope, you see nothing because they are transparent, made of water, so there is no contrast. You can get contrast by some technique that is called differential interference contrast microscopy, which I'm not telling you about, that gives this beautiful picture like craters on the moon. But these are sort of three-dimensional renderings of the somas of cells. So you see that each cell has a body and each cell in this case has a pipette implanted into its stomach. So here, what we did was a little bit more ambitious than what was technically impossible to do in vivo. Instead of Hubel and Wiesel that had this tungsten electrode, very tiny, nearby an electrode, so like a microphone was here listening to the extracellular signal, here we did more. We got a pipette. This is the sort of top view of a conical glass pipette that has been sectioned by light, just because the microscope is creating some sort of light section. So that's why it looks like a triangle, and it's empty inside, and I will tell you why it's empty. And we push it almost inside the cell, because I wanted to see, to measure the electrical potential inside. I'm not happy with outside. Outside is boring. Okay, the only thing I get is a very tiny signal of a few, say, 100 microvolts, but this is just me speaking and somebody from outside of the class listening. I want to hear the whole story. I want to enter into the stomach of this cell. And if you do, you measure it on a voltmeter, you measure a negative minus 70 mV. And people call it with some strange nomenclature compared to engineers; they call this polarization. They say that the cells were polarized in the sense that they were not zero, so there was a polarization.

And sometimes this polarization goes away because these cells, particularly these pyramidal cells, in a time that is so fantastically small, and I'm fascinated by that because in a matter of a millisecond, or hundreds of microseconds, you have that this electrical potential can change very rapidly, incredibly rapidly for being a biological system. The world is able to commute and to open and close or to switch like a transistor so fast, and it's made of proteins, blobs, gel, ions, and the ions are moving slowly. It's not like electrons that are moving... okay, they are not moving fast, it's the electric field that moves fast in a wire. Let's say you don't have transistors that are operating at the gigahertz range. Here you have proteins. You have fatty acid molecules. What is changing so fast? And fast is fascinating to me because this is the time scale of thought. I'm thinking right now with action potentials changing rapidly over the time scales of around one millisecond. So the time of an action potential, this is called an action potential, as opposed to a resting potential, for obvious reasons. One is at rest, one is doing something, we don't know what, but it's doing something, is a fraction of a millisecond. Let's say half a millisecond. And it goes up to +30 millivolts. So minus 70 to plus 30 is 100 millivolts, it's 0.1 volts, which is remarkable. One... okay, now I had one banana but I also had a dish of pasta today. But still, it's not chat GPT and it's not my computer that is powered by an 80-volt power supply. It's with a few watts I'm able to sustain myself. So understanding why the hell you have -70 mV... if I can understand as a next step why the membrane potential can be changing in time, and it changes over time in cells that are called excitable. Neurons, some pancreatic cells, they are secreting hormones such as insulin, so the pancreatic beta cells. Muscles, of course, myocytes and cardiomyocytes. These are all cells in which the electrical potential changes, and apparently it's a trick that nature evolved to convert electrical signals into either information in the world of the brain, or motor actions, or mechanical contractions, so changes in reality, changes in elasticity. And because electricity is so fast and so easy to transmit, that was the way you could command and release, say having chemical release, so having chemical messaging and electrical messaging and mechanical messaging. So that's why there's this investigative work that I have to involve you with.

So it's essential, and if you are dead, you don't have this. This could be a question. You could probably say, "Okay, I could understand why this is -70 millivolts." Maybe your first guess would be that inside there are many more negatively charged particles than outside. It's a legitimate hypothesis. If you think carefully, you could also reach the opposite conclusion that you have a lot of positively charged ions outside and very few positively charged ions inside. And I would say you're close with both but it's more complicated than that. And the fact that in half a millisecond the membrane potential can change so rapidly leaves you with a question: how could it be? I mean these ions are fat, they have a mobility and this mobility is not so... they're not supersonic. They still have to swim, and if you are a swimmer or if you like swimming, you know that in solution you have friction, and this friction is quite remarkable. It's increasing the faster you go. So if you double the speed, the friction doubles. So it's Stokes' law. We will see it probably next week. So it's not clear how you could get something that is reacting electrically so fast with ions that are so sloppy. You can think, if you want, maybe you already know how this happens. But first I'll start with an omnipresent description that is unfortunately adding a little bit of a degree of complexity that I don't like. And this comes because you have physicists as well as chemists dealing with this electrolyte. An electrolyte is a solution in which you have charged particles. And, I mean, both were studying these systems. Chemists, they studied electrochemistry. And physicists studied electromagnetism. And they used, unfortunately, different conventions and different words. So, you have some solute, which is aqueous. Maybe it can be water, and we have a solvent, which is what is dissolved in this aqueous solution. And you can basically refer to the amount of this stuff, these balls, these particles, in two ways. They are equivalent. You could count per unit of volume. So you could literally take a small volume. Maybe you want to take it very small so that you can move this volume here and here and here. You count how many molecules are there. And you express this as a density, something that you know already. So the density is the number per unit of volume. So you take the number and you divide by the volume. And you divide by the volume because you don't want your choice to be affected by that specific volume that you chose. So you normalize by the volume. And chemists did the same, but they were actually not using counts, because they were already aware that in solution you don't have, like in the solar system that you have, how many planets are there? 10, 15, whatever. So a few numbers. In solution you have billions and billions of particles, so it's not practical to count them, and they are used to using a different measuring unit, which is very similar to when you say half a dozen, *mezza dozzina*, or three dozen. So, okay, what is special about the number 12? Okay, instead of saying 6 or 24 or 36, I just make it shorter and I say half a dozen or two dozens or three dozen. It's the same thing, or you could say centuries, four years. You could say one century instead of saying 100 years. It's purely a matter of laziness, maybe, or of convenience. So chemists were using moles. Have you ever heard about moles, molar concentration? And so these guys were counting in numbers, these guys were counting in dozens, and they were also using liters instead of volumes measured in, say, cubic centimeters or cubic decimeters. They were using liters because they were handling liquids. And moles per liter is called molarity. And it's indicated by a big M. Instead, the mole is sometimes indicated by "mol," written m-o-l. So it's not the animal. So this is a mole, but it's a different mole. And it's a purely conventional thing. It's the number of atoms in 12 grams of an isotope of carbon. So, okay, and how many were there? It's the Avogadro number. So it's 6.022 times 10 to the 23 molecules. This is a pure convention. So this could have been in another... no, another universe, in another timeline where it was not Avogadro or other chemists, whatever. So if it was the Middle East, like it was highly developed in terms of mathematics, and particularly mathematics, I'm thinking of Persian mathematicians, we could have ended up with something else. But, okay, conventionally we are stuck with this Avogadro number. This is the reference. So they are used to counting in 6 times 10 to the 23 multiples, because molecules are so many.

I'll conclude here and we'll close it. So if I want to go from one to the other, the only thing I have to be careful about is that I have to remember how a liter is converted into volume, and how one mole is converted into a number of molecules. So these two numbers. So if I have a solution that is concentrated one millimolar, it means that I have one millimole per liter. So 10 to the minus 3 moles divided by a liter. Literally I express it with, okay, 1 cubic decimeter that I can write it as 1,000 cubic centimeters. And then, okay, I'll divide this and I can express it as 6 times 10 to the 17 ions per cubic centimeter. So here, there is nothing to understand. The only thing is that going from one world to the other, you have a conversion factor. That's all. For next time, although you do have it on the slides, the solution, try to see whether it's a very trivial thing that I do as an exercise anyway. So, okay, this is, apart from the way you measure the volume, be careful, so it's the Avogadro number, but the volume has to be carefully converted. I'll ask you to tell me how many ions would be in a spherical cell filled with 150 millimolar of potassium. Just try. It's the only thing that you have to remember is maybe the volume of a sphere, which fine, you can look it up on Google, on a book, but it's not difficult per se. Maybe you don't remember it anymore because you didn't use it. And another thing that is interesting, you could, if you want, you can ask, what if all these ions were not uniformly distributed in the volume but they were instead distributed just around the membrane, which is actually the case, because the solution is a conductor. What would be the surface density? So can you go from a volumetric density to a surface density? And we can see, well we do have it on the slides, but otherwise we'll see it next week together. Thank you, and as usual, if you have questions, please come to me, otherwise I will not be able to help.
