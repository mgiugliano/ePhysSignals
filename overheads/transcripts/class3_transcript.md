Okay. Okay.

This is the third test of audio because the other time, despite the ambient microphone, the audio was not a great deal. I hope it *did* help you, but in this way, you should feel better here and I'm for sure able to provide this signal to the registration. Let's see how it is.

### Announcements

Three announcements. The first one is my personal curiosity. Has anyone read the material given during the first lesson on GitHub? The readings? The *Bignami* of Neurobiology, 2-3 pages. The book of Hubel, "Occhio, Cervello, Visione". Why do you think? Ok, ok.

*Potete iniziare a guardare quel materiale. Non è, diciamo, deletario, è fatto per potervi dare degli elementi utili. Se invece sapete già tutto di neurobiologia e di elettrofisiologia cellulare a un livello divulgativo, eccetera, ignorate il mio commento.*

The second comment, the second comment, the second comment is *legato* to my deficiencies. The other time I was *impantanato* to remember the definition of logarithm. The problem is that I don't remember the things I have to remember. The only thing I remember is that the logarithm is the inverse. *Se vi ricordate il mio*, I crashed because the mnemonic phrase didn't come to me: the logarithm is the quantity that I must put as the exponent of a certain base to get the argument of the logarithm. And here I am going to be because the logarithm of $1$ is $0$, and it is the only point in which this $\log(y)$ is remembered because it is the only point in which it is traversing the *asse*, intersecting the axes. And the other thing I have remembered is that for the argument that tends to $0$ from the left, the logarithm becomes negative, becomes negative, becomes negative.

So the only thing I should remember is that the inverse is the inverse of the exponential. So if I apply it to the natural logarithm, which means logarithm in base $e$, this means that here remains $x$. You can also think that this is a rule that makes it a logarithm and becomes a logarithm in base $e$, $e^1$, or, or, is the inverse. *E quindi qui c'è scritto che questa roba qua è l'esponente da dare alla base per avere l'argomento.* If the argument is $0$, what is the exponent that I have to give to $e$ in order to have $0$? I am going to write it again. It is the contrary. What is the exponent that I have to give to $e$ in order to have $1$? $y = 1$, $e^0$, $e^0 = 1$.

Anyway, third *annuncio*, interesting or less. During the first lesson, I told you that with that small amplification of electronics, I was able to measure an electromagnetic signal in a very banal, very *rosso* way, and I was not sure... I have a card of aluminum for food and I have all the circuit, of which I had no time to create something like that. So my operational amplifier with its various things, and its various electrical, was a different one. Two electrical and ground I applied to my body, and here there was the exit from the reference. I made a kind of *carte* and I've covered this circuit in the card. Do you know why I had this idea of getting into the card? If you've ever heard of it, I would like to make two words.

Ok, *e vi dice qualcosa se io dico "gabbia di Faraday"?*

### The Faraday Cage

It can be demonstrated, but we will not do it, maybe you have seen it in some course of electromagnetism, that in reality, dependent on the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation of an arbitrary electromagnetic field, at a certain frequency, it is possible to shield what is inside. And in some way, it has to do with Gauss's theorem; in some way, it has to do with the fact that in a conductor, the charges are arranged, at least in a static, quasi-static way, in a static, quasi-static regime, they are distributed on the surface, not inside. And therefore, it is used to shield electrophysiological recordings.

And if you come to the laboratory, I'll show you that we have, apart from anti-vibration tables that are optical tables—they are tables to avoid vibrations, but that is not a big problem—but above the table, we have mounted a Faraday cage above each table, which costs a *botto*. I am from Genoa and I am sensitive to these aspects because aluminum costs *l'ira di Dio*. In effect, in some cases, instead of an aluminum plate whose thickness is not the *stagnola*, which is even thinner, I believe the paper is about $0.2 \text{ mm}$ of *spessore*, in the case of aluminum, more than $1 \text{ mm}$ or $2 \text{ mm}$ of *spessore*, it is very *pesante*, it is extremely tight and therefore it is not particularly practical. So people use literally some of the *reti da pollaio*, that will be smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic field that you would want to cut off.

I will show you that the interference based on the cell phone is of the order of the cm, is of the order of the centimeter, so I have a fraction of a centimeter if the frequency is of hundreds of megahertz. For this to do it, I don't know, I remember the speed of light and I can, given the frequency, find the *lunghezza d'onda*. This is the same goal.

However, the key that I have not done at home is that this *scatola*, this and this is a point of... On the other side, there is a cable and I can attach it to the oscilloscope or to the *aggeggio* that was a digital-analog converter, digitized, that I would attach via USB to my computer. What I've done is I've *pinzato* this alligator, which is called alligator because it looks like a little alligator. I've *pinzato* the wire, because I wanted to contact the zero ground, but I've *pinzato* the *schermo*. I've *pinzato* a piece of paper. This has probably put all the same level of potential, the entire surface of the external surface was not *more*, in other words, *"appesa"*, as it says in terms of technicality, *"appeso"*, not "floating", and therefore I could have been able to be exactly the same potential as I made my measure.

It may be or may not be of interest.

If there are problems—now, none of you has contacted me, we haven't been doing anything particularly math, we're going to start a little more—I'm at your disposal. Don't expect necessarily the day before the exam, in which maybe I won't have much time to get into it. So if you can, if you want, if you need, you know where to find me.


Let me switch to English. And so, two questions for you.

### Review: Membrane Potential and Avogadro's Number

Do you maybe remember that last time—this is very key, it's a fundamental property—last time I said that all the cells, unless you're dead, unless you are at the thermodynamical equilibrium with your environment (so you're not any more distinct from it, you're completely whole with nature, and you're not Buddhist, so it's for really important things). Every cell has a difference of electrostatic potential inside with respect to the outside. Do you remember this?

And do you remember whether this difference of potential is negative or positive, assuming the convention that is inside with a reference that is outside the cell?

Okay, so you even remember the number. So I don't want... So this is really, really key. So it's negative. And for neurons, it's roughly around between $-60$, $-70$ [mV]. Other cells might have different numbers, but it's still always negative. I'm not aware of any cell that has this difference of potential that is positive.

It's very important because it's a way employed by living matter, by biology. Evolution found a way to make, through possible pores... I'm indicating the door because I'm thinking that I'm making in my mind the stupid analogy that this is the inside of a cell, and if I want to traffic molecules or stuff or food or whatever, coffee, whatever you eat and drink, maybe it's good to have not only doors, but force fields that are maybe working to move stuff from inside, from outside to inside, or vice versa.

Of course, you might have other mechanisms, devices like ionic pumps, and we will see at least qualitatively (maybe Professor Zoli might tell you about them), that are spending energy. And it's... I'm imagining outside a club there is one big muscle guy that is against maybe the electrochemical gradient and is actually taking in or pushing out stuff from inside the room. But that is consuming energy. Instead, if already *per se* you have some sort of electric field, say you have wind because we keep the windows open and just for free you get food in, this is easy, easier, and it doesn't cost energy.

The second thing that I would like to ask you is whether you remember the Avogadro number that we briefly mentioned. It's purely conventional, so there is nothing deep there. And I remind you this is the number of particles or molecules in one mole of matter. So this is in a way the convention. I call 'mole' a stuff that contains, say, an amount of sodium ions or about, say, whatever, water molecules, about chocolate beads, whatever, that have as many elements as the number of Avogadro. Do you at least remember the order of magnitude? $23$, okay, $10^{23}$. That's it. It's just this rough intuition that I would like to push you to develop. Not necessarily to remember things by heart; it will be gone. But at least a little bit, just a couple of things, it might be worth investigating.

### Review: Concentration vs. Density Problem

Did you have troubles attempting at this problem? I assume that the only thing that you had to do in order to answer the question, "if I give you the concentration, can you go back to the density or to the absolute number of ions?" is to remember the Avogadro number, to be careful, and to remember that chemists are friends. They simply had different units and they use litres instead of cubic centimetres, for instance, for defining their reference volumes. And so millimolar is referred to one litre.

And the other thing is maybe the volume of a sphere that you all remember being... Just to be always sure, if it's a volume, it's likely to be measured in cubic meters, cubic centimeters, whatever. Liters is also a measure of a volume. So there must be some $r^3$ or there must... in terms of units. So, okay, $4/3 \pi r^3$, it's been, for me, imprinted, I don't know, in one, I think it was the elementary school, and it was such a very bad experience that I got it imprinted. But you can check that makes sense that this is a volume, and so indeed, the radius of this small cell, spherical cell, is micrometre, so it will be cubic micrometre. In this context, it's stupid, because of course, this is the context so I can convert it to...

I did not convert. I simply made the multiplication $4 / 3 \times \pi$ ($3.14$ blah blah) and then the other thing is that I went to this answer remembering the conversion factor and this glass of beer that you get in Germany that is one liter and is one cubic decimeter, and you can convert it to cubic centimeters if you want.

So it's a huge, huge number of ions. So it makes sense that maybe you want to call this concentration $150$ instead of millimoles, so it seems to be relatively small. It's OK. It's actually quite large concentration for being inside the cell. Normally you don't get such a high concentration. And instead of talking about $18$, $19$ orders of magnitude, numerous molecules or particles.

If you didn't try, I mean you have all the steps. And even for the second question that is: assume that all these ions are distributed in the surface. So they don't stay in the room, in the bulk, but they stay close to the interface with the outside, because maybe the inside is conductive and maybe it's like when you go to the cinema and you don't want to stay... Yeah, this is a stupid comparison. You go to a cinema, you don't want to stay close to your friends because they are not friends, they are enemies, so you try to maximize the relative distance. So if you go to the cinema and you are an ion, a sodium ion, you are going to be repelled from all the others and you will repel the others. So they don't want to stay together. They will be trying to maximize the distance, the relative distance. So they will be accumulating at the surface, at the inner side of the membrane.

And it might be worth just roughly understanding what is the order of magnitude of ions when they are concentrated there. Try. It's stupid. It's very silly. But it may reactivate, unless you have it already engaged, it's a mental mechanism of simply writing and doing algebra and being careful not to make mistakes.

So after this first concept of purely conventional equivalence between concentration and density, we are going to work, you will see today, with these two concepts interchangeably. Mostly we will be talking about concentrations because it's easy to refer to an actual experiment.


### Electrostatic Forces: A Review

I would like to talk about, to refresh, because you certainly are an expert, about the electrostatic forces, particularly the **force of Coulomb**, a French scientist who first described it, and the associated things. So you have a **force**, you have a **field**, and you have a **potential**. It's not that every time that you have a force, then you have a potential. You probably vaguely remember that's what I'm referring to. And I would like just to refresh this, telling you again about the gravitational force and the gravitational force field and the gravitational potential, because the gravitational potential is something that you have, particularly if you go with a bike, you are very comfortable with.

#### Analogy: Gravity

So again, let me first talk about gravity. I don't know why I got this meme. It does random gravity checks. So this guy is Newton, and in terms of gravity compared to electrostatics, it's a little bit easy because you only have one type of mass. I'm not a physicist, so I'm ignoring antiprotons, antiparticles, so I have no idea whether the antiparticles are... they presumably are only antiparticles in terms of electric charge, not in terms of mass. I know about dark energy, but again, I'm ignorant in physics, so I'm only sticking to this classic description that Newton, one giant in the field, had to cope with and intuitively got it. That is, you have mass and the mass is attracting always.

How much? It depends on how the two masses in this case are far apart and how big they are, how concentrated, how dense they are. This is very silly, but I'm just using it just to remind you that forces require vectors. That means in one given point if you want to express quantitatively a force, you have to give me, say, in a Cartesian system, Cartesian axis system, you have to give me the three components. Because I have to identify an arrow. That means a direction and *verso e una direzione*. I don't know how *verso* is in English. So a direction and where the vector, the force, would be pointing to.

In this case, vectors are easy because the direction is the one that is going through both centers of each of those planets or those particles, those masses. And the *verso*, so the direction where these forces are pointing to, is also easy because it's only attractive. So this should be easy, and you probably know that this is a very famous expression for the force, which reconciled planetary motion and motions on Earth.

So, famous apples that are falling from the tree is governed by the same thing that makes planets going around the Sun or orbiting around each other, described by Kepler's laws, but it seems to be as a different thing. The Kepler's laws were okay, they were phenomenological. Also, this is phenomenological because we don't understand gravity, at least I don't think that we understand gravity in a very fundamental way. So this is describing in a unified way. And you know that the force, you remember, is proportional to how big are the masses, according to the product, and inversely depending on the square of the distance. And there is the famous gravitational constant that I don't remember, I don't indicate it.

So I indicate like this the intensity, the norm, the modulus, the amplitude, the intensity of the force, because the direction and the *verso*, the direction and the way they are pointing to, are just mentioned verbally. No, the direction is the line that is connecting the two centers of masses.

And sometimes, like particularly say when you have really, really big masses in astrophysics, maybe you don't want to deal with a property that depends on both. If you have two masses, you want to say, I want to have something that is a property of space. This is a very deep concept in physics, and it's when you switch from force to **field**. So, yes, you put a mass in one spot, and then the space starts to have, depending on where... there is a symmetry, of course, like this shading that is a little bit grayer in the center and lighter in the extreme. It's a property of the space. How much? If I place a test particle, a test mass here, then I will experience a force directed in the direction to connect in the minimal direction, in the minimal distance direction, connecting my test mass to the center of the bigger masses, but it could be even a small mass, it doesn't matter, and the direction is attractive. So the sign is attractive.

When you do that, you want to basically, assuming that the mass here is the big $M$ and say is the mass of our planet, you want to normalize, you want to have some description that is no longer measured in Newtons. This would be the measuring unit of this thing, which is going to be Newton. It's not going to be Newton anymore, it's going to be Newton per kilogram because I don't want to have something that depends on my test. I want to use any test, so I want to go to this description that I indicate with $E$. And you see there is no small $m$. But I can go if you give me the field, I can get the force and vice versa.

Does this sound completely unfamiliar to you? Probably not. Okay, so you're not too scared. Let me remind you. Okay, so Newton per kilogram.

So the other ingredient that I would like to mention, to refresh you, is that some force fields, they are **conservative**. That means that the work done to move one particle from one spot to another one depends only on the initial and the final position, not on the trajectory. You know it well if you are biking because you love to stay at some... Okay, I'm spoiling something that comes later. So those fields that are conserving mechanical energy are called conservative. And I'm just giving you as a fact. I'm not proving it. I don't even remember how to prove it, although I knew once many years ago.

You can go, you can get rid of the complexity of vector fields. The fact that in principle at every point in space you have three components. And so it might be a little bit complicated to handle and to manipulate and to make calculations on vector fields. So if there is one scalar field, one numerical quantity, that's fine. Okay, in every point might be different, but it gives me just one number, not three numbers, one number that is called **potential**. Then I can maybe use it more conveniently.

The point is, okay, how do I have, is it possible? For this conservative force field it's possible. There is a function, it's a function of the point. Okay, it might change also in time, but it doesn't matter. That is such that if I take its derivative, or more correctly, the **gradient**, so the derivative with respect to space, and of course in 3D it depends, okay, so which of the three directions you want to take the derivative? You want to assess how these things are changing in space. So you have to tell me where. And you maybe remember that in vector analysis, you have the gradient. You don't have the $\nabla$ operator. You have this thing here. And you don't have necessarily the derivative. Well, in a case of a spherical symmetry, yes, you have. And we will actually stick only to spherical symmetry.

And you also remember that this is basically, since some derivative differentiation operation is involved, I could define $V$, well, I cannot define, I can spot $V$, but also $V$ plus any constant, $25$ or $-52$, would work equally well. Provided that this constant is constant in space, when I take the gradient, or the derivative with respect to $r$, it's the same. So that's why we say that this potential is defined apart from a constant. You should all be familiar with these things.

And particularly, I remind you that we conventionally, I stress it in a moment a little bit more, we call zero gravitational potential the level of the sea, purely by convention. We claim that at the level of the sea, the gravitational potential is zero. But yeah, okay, you could have made any other choices. So in other words, you add or subtract something so that the position $r$ where that's potentially zero, sorry, where, no... So at that position, say at the level of the *sea*, these $V$ and the constant are, say, cancelling and you get what you want, that is conventionally you call it zero. So through tweaking of that constant, you can say that at this point the potential is zero and it's an arbitrary choice, there is nothing magic. And mathematically is written there. You go from a scalar field to a vector field because basically you have a gradient.

The other catch is that for this definition we consider **minus**. So the potential is the function such that when you take **minus** the gradient you get the field, the gravitational field. And so for instance, without particularly being a genius, if you consider this mathematical expression and you remember one of the few derivatives that I asked you to remember, $1 / x$, okay since here the independent variable is $r$, if you take the derivative of $1 / r$, you probably know that is $-1 / r^2$. Of course you can derive it properly that you have to take the numerator, you multiply by the derivative of the denominator, etc. But say it's one of the few derivatives that you could learn, you could remember by heart. And indeed if you define $-Gm / r$, when you take the gradient, you take the derivative with respect to $r$, and you change the sign, you go back to the expression of the field that is $Gm / r^2$. So $r^2$ is always there in the field and in the force. In the potential it goes like $1 / r$, which may or might not be deep as a concept but it's a consequence of this.

I don't know whether it's now or later I have a very silly meme where you will see that one person is maybe overwhelmed by working with vectors but with scalars it's a different story, it's easier. I have also a demo to show you. And okay here you get back what I just said.

So something that we can do, we can just to motivate something that you might learn or remember mnemonically, that masses (like your bike) move in the gravitational field of the planet from points with **higher** gravitational potential to points with **lower** gravitational potential, from higher altitude to lower altitude. It's the same thing because the force field is attracting and is attracting everything to the center of the planet and that's why the potential is... as more when you... is negative and when you increase the distance the potential is getting smaller in absolute terms. And in fact, if you think, okay, so there is here the big mass, here is the distance. If I plot the function $V(r)$, it's minus. So the minus is making it flip that hyperbola from the first quadrant to the fourth quadrant. And so intuitively you would say if I have a test mass and I put it here, well it will be attracted. So technically it's moving along this potential profile, indeed going from points where in absolute terms you have higher potential to points that are lower potential.

I'm making this as a premise, although maybe it's irrelevant and trivial for you, because in the electrostatic case it gets a little bit trickier, and I wanted to refresh it. There it's trickier because you can have different kind of properties of the particles. They can be charged positively or negatively.

Something that I'm not telling you is that if you consider that expression and you take the Taylor first order... I don't know whether you have been taught like this ever, I was not, but if you take the Taylor expansion to the first order and you simply are considering that you move around some certain distance from the center of the mass, here I'm precisely thinking of our planet, and you are around this value, so you're approximating locally this function just with a straight line, around this $R_0$, and you call $h$ the quantity that you want to investigate. It's $R_0 + h$. $h$ is your new variable. You basically recover, because of the sign, this is just a number, and it's where the story of the level of the sea... you recover the intuition that the more $h$, the more the height, the larger is the gravitational potential. Play. Just try to do it by yourself, and it may connect few synapses in your brain.


### The Coulomb Electrostatic Force

But I would like to talk about the **Coulomb electrostatic force** and I wonder whether, if you consider these two fundamental forces, you ever thought which is stronger? Well, you have it in the slides, but if you knew already which one is stronger. Is Coulomb better than Newton, stronger than Newton? Okay, so the counter-example would be that I have to find a mass so large but weakly... with very, very small charge. Okay, let me consider not an arbitrary case, but just the case of chemical or even biological molecules.

The fact that Coulomb is extraordinarily larger, I think it's $38$, $40$ orders of magnitude, I don't remember by heart, is the reason why life could develop. It's because chemical macromolecules or even chemical molecules could stay together. Because if it was only due to gravitation, it would be so weak that basically it's as if it's not there. And molecules or ions or macromolecules would simply fly away. A DNA molecule would never be able to exist in a universe where you don't have such a huge predominance of the Coulomb electrostatic interactions.

And do you know why there is attenuation for both, for the gravitation as well as the electrostatic forces, $1$ over the square *root*, sorry, the **square of the distance**? You could try to search on the internet for this explanation. It's something related to the geometry of space. I'm not daring saying space-time, it's space. And particularly it's clear when you think of electromagnetic radiation in the visible. So light is electromagnetism, and light, the attenuation goes like $1 / r^2$. Because if you imagine that you have a star in the center and it's emitting some certain density of light, after a given distance, this sphere of light is becoming considerably larger and larger and larger. For some conservation of energy, you would expect that everything is conserved, it's not being removed or deleted. But your eye is very tiny, so it's not integrating the entire volumetric, actually it's called *angolo solido*, it's not integrating in 3D, it's just picking up a little bit, a fraction of this. And the further apart you are, the more what you capture is $1 / r^2$. It's very interesting and there are many even light talks or light papers and things on this $1 / r^2$.

So it's **$39$ orders of magnitude stronger**. That's the French Coulomb, instead Newton was British. Near the St. Pancras Station in London, if you go there, there is a statue of Newton. And again, this is, if you consider elementary particles, they are charged. And addressing the correct criticism by your colleague, I could say that the mass is probably not as represented as charge. Charge is... so you could have a very tiny particle in terms of very light, but extremely charged in comparative terms. But it was a good objection.

So for electrostatic fields, you have two... so I'm considering the static or quasi-static case. So I'm considering a regime in which you don't have the generation of a magnetic field that is concatenated to the electric field because this is changing over time. If it changes over time, there will always be, but the intensity and the wavelength can be neglected. So I'm considering the case where things are not moving. And I remind you that you have two classes, two families. You have one property that the particles, if they are charged, they are say blue and they are red. So they can be of one class or they can be of the other class. Charged positively or charged negatively. It's purely conventional that we call something positive and something negative.

What is important to remember is that if you have the same quality, then the force is **repulsive**. See the sodium ions going to the cinema but not liking each other and so being repelled and causing repulsion from each other. If they are of different species... the opposites attract, even there was a song by Paula Abdul many years ago in the 80s. And so if they are of a different quality, they **attract**.

And it's the same thing. It goes depending on with some sort of constant, and here it has been unpacked because it's relevant in a moment to talk about it. But it depends on the product of these two qualities or quantities that are called the charge. So it's an elementary property. I'm not entering into the details what is the charge. And apologies here, I should have not called it $r_0$. $r_0$ is the specific distance in these two examples over the independent variable or the name of this axis that is called generically $r$. So it goes like $1 / r^2$ like for gravitation and it depends on the product. But here the product can be negative, so the sign of the force can be indeed... can be repulsive, not only attractive.

And again, same story, if I have say a positively charged particle and I put it here, assuming that my test particle is always positive just purely by convention, I would like to have something to tell me that if I place something... to express that if I *press*... if I push or place the test particle in different... test charge in different spots around this, I am basically measuring a property of the space, not of the two specific charges. And again I go from the Coulomb force to the **force field**. And you see that there is only one $Q$, the $Q$ the charge of this one, not the other one. And again it's not Newton, it's Newton per... before it was Newton per kilogram, here it's Newton per Coulomb. And by reworking the unit you can also express this as Volt per meter.

I have to think, I don't remember why... oh sorry... yeah sorry, I'm... yeah, my brain was interpreting $V$ as voltage. I'm tired, I did not sleep, and this *Olt* I thought it was $dt$ and I thought, no why? Why should be $dt$? The time should not be there. No, it's **Volt per meter**. I remember this because if you go on the news and you look for safety limits of electromagnetic or electrostatic force fields near the antennas of Radio Maria in Rome, you actually have a number that is expressed in Volt/meter. If it's too large, Volt/meter, then it's dangerous for cells. Obviously it's fascinating to understand, okay, but why it's dangerous? What exactly is the interaction with the biological hardware?

#### Permittivity

What else? Something important that is different from the electrostatic case, sorry, from the gravitational case is that you have this quantity here apart from the $4\pi$ that again has geometrical reasons, but... and about spheres, but I'm not talking about that. You have one value of a constant that is called **permittivity of the vacuum** ($\epsilon_0$) and another one that is adimensional and is called the **relative permittivity of the medium** ($\epsilon_r$). And here there is another lesson. So this one $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity. Permittivity means that it gives permission. So the larger it is (because it's at the denominator) the smaller is the force.

And this is key for having chemical reactions and life being developed in **water**, in aqueous media, instead of in the vacuum. Because the other value, so this is $\epsilon_0$ is expressed in Farad per meter, but the other relative permittivity is without dimension. One is the permittivity of the vacuum. If you look at what is the permittivity of water, it's almost two orders of magnitude larger. And being at a denominator it means that you have a sodium chloride molecule and you put it in water, then you... because the force that was much more intense in the vacuum, you put it in water, or even in dry air is not too far, okay it's around $1$. But as soon as you put it in water, the two ions constituting the two molecules... constituting particles constituting the molecules, sodium and chloride, may fly apart, fly away, just because you have $1 / 100$. So it's $100$ times less intense this electrostatic force.

And what it's interesting is that for phospholipids, now I'm throwing it like this without any justification, you have a value that is in between. Cells are made, particularly the cell membrane is made of lipids, and I'm particularly fascinated, we will briefly discuss it later, that the first time people started thinking of that cells, it was in the 19th century, that cells might have a membrane. And the membrane is a crucial point because it makes inside different than the outside. It makes a distinction between the environment and what is not the environment, what is *me* and what is *not me*, is not necessarily so obvious concept. And people could not observe with microscopes, because it's so thin, so small, could not make inference or guess about the thickness. And they did it purely by... the first time they did it by electrical methods, precisely because it was possible to *know* the relative permittivity of individual components of the lipids.

And to me it's fascinating that you don't see something, compare it to a capacitor, and we will see later why the membrane is acting as a capacitor, you can guess the distance between the two plates of the capacitor, so the thickness of the membrane, by an electrical measure. It's not the first time. There is another... for understanding how these pores, these doors that make the inside of the cell connected to the outside of the cells... the first time people could not see them and they could only measure it electrically. So it's a primate of electricity and electrical methods compared to optical methods, to optics and microscopy.

#### Quantization of Charge

The other things that I would like to remind you, because we will use it often, is that the electron, so the charge in general is **quantized**. You cannot have an arbitrary value of charge, it comes in multiples of an elementary value that is $1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ Coulomb}$. And for instance in the case of this sodium chloride that is dissociating in water, you probably know better than I do this is reversible. And indeed when I write $\text{Na}^+$ and $\text{Cl}^-$, what I mean is that this guy has a positive charge and because there is only one plus and I'm thinking of the valency etc., I'm specifically referring to this value. And when there is a minus, so this one is negatively charged with the opposite sign so that both are somehow canceling so that the molecule is electroneutral. This you should be roughly familiar with all these things.

So this is the story of vector fields. In every point even in 2D it might be quite daunting. So this guy is depressed. Maybe you don't know who this guy is but is famous in my generation, well even in the previous generation. If you have scalar quantities it is much better.


#### Electrostatic Potential and Superposition

So even in this case, the electrostatic force fields are conserving mechanical energy and therefore you have one function of the point such that if I take minus and I take the gradient, I can describe the electrostatic field. So in other words, given the electrostatic field, it always exists a potential function. And this potential function is again, is defined apart from a constant. Instead, if here it was, instead of $V$ it was $V + 25 \text{ millivolt}$, okay, when you take the gradients the constant will go away because the derivative of a constant is zero. So you get the same electric field regardless of these reference. And the reference of these aluminum foil that I wrapped my circuit around... so it's not anymore the level of the sea where I say, so the height is zero and so the potential I call it zero. Here is just an arbitrary point where I call the potential zero. And normally is, it is considered in what is called the electrophysiological convention, not a very original name, zero for me is outside the cell where I have some sort of reference electrode. But we will be more on this.

So the space or the expression of this potential... before for the gravitational was easier because it was $G$ and here it's just a number, there is nothing to understand. This is one number that it's known... goes like the charge divided by the distance. So it's $1 / r$ for the exact same reason.

Let me probably stop... let me see what is next. Yeah, okay, this is... this is important. One minute and I'm done.

So something that is very cool, but I'm not... I have no time to really to go more in details, is that Maxwell equations are linear in the sense that the **superposition of the effects** holds. If you want to understand what is the electrostatic potential, so it's a property of the space, in this point, $P$, I choose that point... When you have this collection of small, large, positive, negative charges, it's enough that you consider the superposition of the situation that you would have if you had only one charge at a time.

If you had only this big one that is red, you would have... you have to calculate the distance, and you will have, okay, this pre-multiplication factor is just a number of stone, you will have only $Q_1$ divided by the distance between this $Q_1$ charge to the point $P$. Now you make disappearing the red large charge, you make the appearing only the blue small that is considerably further apart and you would have in that case, you would have $Q_2$ divided by the distance.

So if you want to understand or express what happens if you have in one point, say inside the cell, you have $-70 \text{ millivolt}$ with respect to the outside where it's zero... you may say, okay, well if you... if I know where the charges are located, I can basically consider a sort of superposition of the effects, which is some sort of weighted sum of the charges. Clearly, okay, one big charge, if it's a big positive charge, is going to contribute positively to the potential over there. But if it's very far apart, $1 / r$ will attenuate that contribution.

So with this you could maybe start thinking, okay, maybe if I see $-70 \text{ millivolt}$, if this holds true, maybe it means that I have many negatively charged particles inside the cell. And that would be perfectly legitimate, but it's not entirely correct.

If you have questions now in the break... let's stop and wait for $10$ minutes.

Let me restart. You... I will point you to it in a moment, where with a so-called web app, that means it's an application that is only requiring a web browser, you can go and say, let me not take it, say, I can take a lot of negative charge, in this case it's $1$ minus... $-1 \text{ nanocoulomb}$, $-1 \text{ nanocoulomb}$, it's a very small charge. And I can also have a sensor, so this is the test particle, and you see that these are the lines of the force field and it's relatively complicated. I'm having fun, you see? Saturday night, what do you do? I'm having fun playing with charges. And yeah, you can play with it, but see what happens if you are only looking at a scalar quantity. So there is no more arrows. And what remains is some sort of shading that reminds maybe the concentration of, say, smoke. If I should smoke here, there will be a very high density of smoke, of particle here. There will be maybe diffusing, there will be less intense concentration of smoke, less intense value of the electrostatic potential in one spot far that it goes like $1 / r$ and it goes far.

And if I have different distribution of charges... so it's not... This sensor is a voltmeter. So in this... so you see at some distance from this distribution of charge, the electrostatic potential that I... that I'm detecting here in the points identified by the cross, I see minus four... so it seems to be negative. If I get maybe close to the... to the positive charge, they get positive, but otherwise is... is negative. So maybe doesn't get... doesn't get $-70$, but this might say... You could play. After a few minutes you... you will be fed up. This could give you some sort of intuitive understanding of why, first of all, is easier to work with potentials and what does it mean this superposition of the effect, when I remind you the task is to understand why there is this damn $-70 \text{ millivolt}$.

#### Potential, Charge Movement, and Current

Something else that I wanted to... in addition that I wanted to talk about is the exact same story saying that if you have positive charge, so you have one big charge that is positive, a **positive charge** would move from point with **higher potential** to point with **lower potential**. I think I have here... if I have a battery... I hope that you, maybe I said it, I didn't, well it's difficult but I hope that you, well don't do it because it's dangerous, but I hope that maybe in your childhood you had... you licked batteries, particularly the $9 \text{ Volt}$ batteries. But anyway, so one pole of this battery is $1.5 \text{ Volts}$ with respect to the other, it's the negative, but you could... you could say that the difference of potential from here to here is $1.5$. So it means that in this point you have $1.5 \text{ Volts}$. And so if you have a positive charge, because of the potential generated by this big blue charge, it would move along... will be repelled and it will be move along these potential profile, indeed moving from points of high voltage to points of low voltage.

I tell you this because for many years there was the misunderstanding of... centuries? No, years... there was the understanding and still it's the same convention, that electrical currents are... in conductors, in metallic conductors are... is carried by positive charge. And indeed you know that if you have here... you have a circuit, the current goes from the plus to the minus. Well, electrons are negatively charged. And so actually it's the **negative charges** are moving from points with **lower** electrostatic potential to points with **higher** electrostatic potential.

I wanted once in your life to revisit this important concept, to know that it's wrong, it's a different convention, but it kind of fits whatever you do with the story of repulsion or attraction. So if you are in the world of Coulomb, of force field, you only have to remember the sign of the two particles, but if you're in the world of potentials, it's easier. And you only have to remember, like in the gravitational field, you are by bike and the bike naturally goes from points of high potential to points of low potential. And for electrostatic is the same, unless you are a negative charge, which is the exact opposite. And this is indeed what the real electrical currents are carried along.

So here I'm just, it's already since last week that I'm stimulating and saying, okay, $-70 \text{ millivolt}$, what do you think? I told you that now we know or we know again the superposition of the effects and so if you have $-70$, well, it could be that you have a lot of negative charge. Would not be shameful to reason like this, but it can also mean the exact opposite, as we will see in a moment. And again, I hope that you started thinking. I would love if you could keep these *critics* in your brain alive.

### Biophysical Primitives: Mobility and Friction

But first I need other elements, other primitives in biophysics, and one is called **mobility**. It's purely a description, is a conventional description as you will see, of how tough is for one particle to swim in solution, to move in in an aqueous medium, if it is a sodium or *chlorine* ion and if maybe one ion molecularly is fat and another ion is thin, slim.

And I start with the... with the parachute. Do you know why these guys are not dying? Probably you would say, well, it's because of the parachute. Do you know what the parachute is doing? So you probably know that in proximity to the... of the... of the surface of our planet you have an acceleration of $9.8 \text{ square meters per second}$ or meters per second square. So every second you accelerate, you change your velocity by roughly $10 \text{ meters per second}$. So why is not dying *to see*, crushing himself or herself in the ground?

Which is by the way, is the same reason why when it rains, the drops of rain are not damaging your scalp, killing you on an instant. They should. The reason why they don't is because they have, well there is not really the parachute, but because they are... the drops of water, of rain and the parachuters are moving in a dense medium that is air. And air is causing **friction**, viscous friction.

So you have in the general case... you don't have raindrops and you don't have parachuters... but you have a particle that is moving in an *aqua* solution under some external force. I don't care whether it's gravity, whether it's electrostatic potential, sorry, electrostatic forces, I don't care. And I only have to invoke or remember one guy, **Stokes**, who studied friction. And actually it is very interesting because he studied how the geometry of a particle in a solution is affecting this friction. But for the sake of simplicity here we don't care, we just basically say that the friction that is familiar to those of you who are maybe swimming in the sea is increasing, is proportional to the velocity, is not constant. The faster you go the more the deceleration you experience. And it goes in the opposite direction of course from your motion because it is again, it's a friction, it *tries* to oppose.

So let me invoke Newton's second law of the dynamics, $F = m \times a$. Force equals mass times acceleration. Of course acceleration I express this as a first time derivative of the velocity. And... And again you will see why I'm obsessed by that always boring usual differential equation because it's always the same linear first order constant coefficient equation that comes over and over, at least in this course, not in nature but at least in this course.

So here I can write the overall sum of all forces. I'm thinking of a monodimensional case otherwise I will be making a necessary complexity. So I'm considering that there is some sort of direction of motion that I call $x$. $x$ is a coordinate, so I can have some velocity. I can even define an acceleration if you want. And I can define a position. And I can go from one to the other by differentiating, by derivatives. And along this monodimensional coordinate, which is describing the system in all its complexity, I have two forces that are the sum, so $F$ equals mass times acceleration, $M$... is the total force, and the friction is opposing. So if I take this axis along the direction of the motion, say along the direction where I call positive the force that is positive in this direction, then the friction force needs to have a minus. And this $\lambda$ is a constant, is a positive constant and is the... basically is the... is a factor that is describing how big is the viscous friction. And you see here this is given, it's proportional to the velocity. The faster you go... the slower you are... so... so the slower is the... the faster you go the stronger is *these* friction force.

I remind you that these are forces and *these* are the world of velocities, positions, and acceleration. So they are slightly different beasts and the difference is because here you have a derivative. Again, it's the always usual boring differential equation and if I write it down, so you actually see here, friction I replace $-\lambda v$.

I told you the other time that if you want to make me happy you have to ensure that if you present me with a differential equation that the state variable in the left hand side, in this case, has a minus sign. Because in my brain I have always the automatic reaction saying, okay, yeah, the solution, at least the solution of the homogeneous equation associated, is an exponential. I have to put the exponential to something and if this something has a negative sign, I'm happy because the system is dissipative and this friction is dissipating energy. It's actually dissipating energy in an irreversible way as heat. So things should not explode. I should not expect the velocity to exponentially increase, *vice versa*. They should be exponentially *decay*. So make me happy and always keep an eye on what you have from the other hand side of this equation because this is what you're going to put in the exponent. True, there is this constant here $m$, but $m$ is positive so okay, I could divide both sides of this equation by $m$ and here will be $-\lambda / m$. Okay, still it will remain positive. So the minus, I'm grateful for this minus which is the Stokes law.

And of course this is not an homogeneous equation, so in principle I'm hand-waving, but you allow me to assume that this non-homogeneous term is constant in time. It's given and it's a constant. It's not an arbitrary function of time. And it could be as constant as gravitation or as constant as the Coulomb force that a big charge is exerting on one charged particle that is entering in solution and moving along this direction. It doesn't change in time. I don't care whether it changes in space. Here it's a differential equation with time. If that's the case, I can apply those heuristics. And so if the force in terms is constant, then likely the input term is also constant. And I can identify which constant it is by direct substitution.

Anyway, to make a long story short, I don't even care about the initial condition that would allow me to select one among the infinite solutions of this differential equation. Because you see here, it's when I'm very happy. So this term is going to vanish. And the reason why this is vanishing is because friction has the property of making particles approaching the so-called **limit velocity**. So, parachuters, because of friction of the air and the same for water raindrops, are not constantly accelerating over... At some point they stabilize. I spoke to people throwing themselves from an airplane, just skydiving, I think it's called, even without, before opening the parachute. The first few seconds are ugly, because you feel it in your stomach, the acceleration when you're falling, but at some point, then you don't accelerate anymore. And in principle, it's indistinguishable from a reference frame that is not moving.

And this second is given by this constant, which is the inverse of the time constant of this equation. It tells when the transient is gone, is over. So this friend of mine doing skydiving, after a while, his velocity became constant. Okay, it might be unpleasant, because particularly your visual scene, the visual field is expanding, so you're clearly, if you don't open the parachute, you're dying. You're not constantly accelerating and your stomach is not telling you that. And... and the reason why this can be done, we can neglect it, is because the mass and the... so this ratio between $\lambda$ and $m$ is very, very, very large because the mass is very, very small. And if I have this that is very, very large it means that one divided by this quantity, that is the time constant, is very small. So in a matter of picoseconds or faster, an ion in solution will reach this limit velocity.

And therefore I can write this relationship which is the limit velocity, so the **velocity is basically proportional to the force field**. Newton would be upset and would say, "beware, I think this is... it goes to the time before Newton." People... forces were directly translating into movement, and Newton said, "No, force is equivalent to an acceleration, not to a velocity." Unless you're in a viscous medium. If you are in a viscous medium, then if you double the force instantaneously, well, it's not really instantaneously because you have still some latency, but say, very rapidly, you're changing the velocity. This is crucial because we are swimmers. We stay in solution.

And people, instead of calling $\lambda$ the Stokes coefficient, Stokes parameter, Stokes coefficient, they call $u$ **mobility**, $1 / \lambda$. So this is my definition of mobility and it tells that the velocity is proportional to the force field. And you will see in a moment why this is relevant.

I warn you that in the literature, there is, in books, you have also the tables with the numbers, with numerical numbers of people that calculated the mobility, and how they could calculate it, well, they simply... they had to calculate the velocity. They knew the force, they calculated the velocity, and they basically had the mobility. But they had... they worked with the charged particles. And in our case, this is what is called **absolute mobility**. So it's a relationship between the force and the Stokes parameter. And it's measured in meters per second Newton.

If you have the charged particles, in the book you call it... and they are basically referred to not absolute, but **electrical mobility**. And instead of being a force, it's a force field. And so somewhere compared to the force you divide it by a charge. So here in between there is the charge, or if you want really to *spaccare il capello*, if you want to be very picky, you have to put the total charge, so that is the elementary charge multiplied by the valency of that particularly ionic species. And the valency is here in the absolute term is the... the modulus, because I don't care whether it's positive or negative in the settings that I'm used. It's enough that it's making the particle moving. Only just to tell you that if it's there it is measured as meters per Coulomb per second... meter per *cool* divided by seconds per Newton. So just be aware that in books you may find other numbers. It's the same thing apart from this conversion factor.

But anyway, we always stay here and anyway we don't look at numerical numbers. So you can go from one to the other apart from the elementary charge or, yeah, the total charge if you... if you're talking about say calcium ions that in solution they dissociate and they have $Z = 2$. So the valency of a calcium ions is $2$, they have $2$ positive charge, elementary charge.

These are some number and you see that the potassium and sodium and chlorine they are more or less of the same order of magnitude. Some ion has an easier time to swim than others. And you might see some other numbers but they are different units so that's why you don't see exactly the same. It's $10^{-8}$ and here it's $10^{11}$ so you would say it's crazy. No, it's because here somewhere you have $1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ Coulomb}$ at the denominator. But okay, that's it.

This is however wrong, but we don't care, we stick with this approximation because as you know ions in solutions are not swimming like this naked. They don't like to be naked. They are immediately neutralized by water dipoles that are constituting what is called the **hydration sheet**, hydration layer. So sometimes you might have ions that are very slim but they have a very big hydration sheet around them. And otherwise ions that are fat but they have maybe... they are not necessarily more fat than one slim ions with the hydration sheet.

### Flux of Particles

The last conventional things that I need for the following is the **flux of particles**. So I'm thinking of some sort of external fields or forces. I don't know what forces they might be. I anticipate it's not gravity because gravity is, with all due respect to Newton, is very weak and it's not really playing any role. I'm considering mobility, so I'm considering how friction basically, how good is one molecule, particle. Look, particles could even be not electrically charged, and we will see together. So it's not that if you're in solution you need to be electrically charged. There are other phenomena that happens if you're not electrically charged. And then the other thing is some sort of way to describe, to measure, to understand quantitatively how under a certain force, with a given mobility, I give rise to a flow, to a flux of matter.

But I need to be precise because there might be several ways to define flux of particles. How would you define it? What I'm thinking is, I'm thinking of a river. And the river is flowing, and it can be a small river or a large river, and the velocity of the particles can be really large, even if it's small or if it's big. So there are two kind of things in this view. I wonder whether you could suggest me what they are. One needs to be if they are small or large, so some sort of section or cross-section of these flux, so space, surface. And of course there is another quantity which tells me how fast things go. So time is also an important thing.

Any idea? What would you call it? Flux. You would say it's an amount of water... well maybe for electrical currents you know that currents are measured in Amperes. And Coulomb per second. So this, apart from the formal definition, is because people thought, well it's a flux but it's in a wire, maybe in a conductor... well I don't care. It's not a density, it's just an absolute flow and is basically in a given amount of time I move a certain amount of charge, one Coulomb. If I move one Coulomb at every second and I really imagine one big charge, blue charge, that is one Coulomb and is moving, moving to the left in one second, so it's not particularly fast, then I will have one Ampere, which is quite a big current.

Here, I told you I'm interested in if the section or the cross section is large or small. So I'm interested in **densities**. So again, let me see if my method would match yours. So I call it $J$. $J$ might resonate with a current density, but in this case, the particles may or may not be charged. So the units are not necessarily, we will see what the units are with this definition, are not Amperes, because there is no Coulomb, at least not necessarily.

And here is the first time that I can work with both, with either densities or concentrations. And I know how to go from one to the other, so they're not scaring me anymore. And this flux, just for simplicity, I'm considering one-dimensional movement. There is some velocity and there is some external force. But one way is this one. And here you see why physicists would be happy with densities and the chemist would say, "No, let's use mole."

So it's a **number of...** Pick your field, pick your part of the game field. So if you want to be a physicist, say number of particles moving through the surface, the cross-section of the surface. Maybe I would like to make that the surface of passage is not really having an impact. I would like to normalize. So if it's a big $10 \text{ square meters}$, or if it's a very small blood capillary, I don't care. I would like the flux to be a density measure, a specific measure, not an absolute measure. So it's a number of particles moving through a surface, a unitary surface, say one square meter or one square micrometer, in the unit's time interval, exactly like for the current.

And if you like more chemists and you like the moles, it's basically the number of moles moving again, the same thing through the unitary surface in a unitary time interval.

Let me try to graphically unwrap it and you tell me whether I'm... well, it's a crappy sketch. Here again my direction of movement, now I put it horizontally because it's... I don't know, I go in the lexicographic order from left to right. And although here I was thinking of something falling in a jar made of liquid... but... so with the jar with a bottle made of liquid is because maybe gravity would make this particle slowing down and reaching a limit velocity. Here I don't care. So I'm assuming that the force is along this direction and it's pushing the particles from left to right. And here I conventionally identify a reference surface that I call $\Delta S$, delta because I'm perverse, at some point maybe it will go to zero or I will simply normalize it, I will divide by it. And I have a watch and I wait one $\Delta t$. Nothing is infinitesimal so far. They are not infinitesimal measures yet.

But I basically say if things are moving, it means that they do, in a unit of time, they move of some length, some meters per second. So in one second or in alpha second, things will be moved. If I take two pictures, one now and one after one $\Delta t$, I can probably identify a displacement of all these particles that were, at the time of the first picture, they were all stuck in this coordinate, at this $x$ coordinate, that they were basically in this frame. I'm really imagining, I'm imagining it like many particles of really a fluid or smoke, so there are many. So if I slice it in that plane I will have many, not all of them because of course they are dispersed in a volume as concentrations or as density, but if I slice it, there will be few of these particles at that position.

So after $\Delta x$, basically those particles, I assume that they all move with the same speed and there is only one direction that they can move, so... well then I draw another rectangle, another area, that it tells me where they are now, those that *where* $\Delta t$ ago they were in the first... in the first surface. Maybe you see where I'm going because now that I have $\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$ I'm tempted to say, yeah, okay, but $\Delta x / \Delta t$ is a velocity. Well, it's a uniform velocity, otherwise I would need to take the limit. But even in that case I'm fine, I know... no... calculus, so in that case I could take the limit. So if the velocity is not, should velocity not be constant in time, I could still handle this situation.

But here I have that $\Delta x / \Delta t$ is basically the velocity. And another interesting thing is that basically here $\Delta x$ and $\Delta S$ identify a **volume**. And this volume is the volume that these particles basically they identified, they, whatever, in the $\Delta t$. And I know how many particles are in a given volume. If you tell me the volume, since I know the concentration or the density, I can tell you what is the absolute number of particles in that volume. And this is what I'm going to do.

So the definition here is number of ions that cross the first surface, blah, blah, normalized by the, so per unit of area and per unit of time. So I have to divide by the area and divide by the time interval. But I know how many ions are here in this box. Because it's enough that I have the density and I multiply by the volume. If I like to work with densities... if I like to work with concentration, I do the same. But there will be an Avogadro number in between.

And you see that if I do this... I think I have it here for concentration for those who are like me, more fond of moles. So here you will ask, I want to work in moles because I know that sodium is $150 \text{ millimolar}$ concentrated there. And what happens if I apply some electric field? And so they will move, and I want to use the fact that I have $150 \text{ millimoles per liter}$. So here you see that I can simplify $\Delta S$, and I remain with $C$ or $\rho$, whatever it is, the density or the concentration, times the velocity, which is simple, which is okay.

#### The Nernst-Planck Equation (Thorell Formula)

Let me do another step invoking mobility, because with mobility, I can go from velocity to force. So here, with this definition, which is called the formula of Thorel, is a guy particularly, say, for the molar fluxes, not for the particle fluxes. Look, we have to commit, but we know how to go from one world to the other.

The flux is given by the **mobility** multiplied by the **concentration** multiplied by the **force**.
$J = u \cdot C \cdot F$

And it's not so impossible, so strange, because if the mobility of this particle is very, very small because the particle is a very poor swimmer, it's very big, and Stokes is slowing him or her down a lot, then the flux will be small. If you don't have enough molecules, if the concentration is small, the flux will be small. It cannot be larger if you don't have stuff there. And finally, this is clearly, it makes more sense, the stronger the force, the stronger is the flux. This is also making sense. If I blow air, the stronger is the force that I put with my lungs, the stronger will be, the more intense will be the flux with this definition. So, and the fact that here is a linear, it's a proportional dependency, is something that I like. It's sufficiently simple.

So this is called the Thorel formula, and again, depending on your choice, if you're talking about moles or particles just be careful, connect your brain for a moment and then disconnect it and play or use units. So when you write units like moles divided by square meters divided by second... will be the unit of this flux. And you see it's a density because in the denominator you have a square meters which is the cross section. Again I don't want to work yet with the current because I want to work at some point with densities. I don't know the sections like I don't know how many particles I have. I'm happier to talk about concentrations.

So here is if you want to go from the flux to the current density. So flux is agnostic in terms of electric... electric charge. But if you want to do that it's enough if you want to go for... this is **current density**. The current density means Coulomb per second, fine, but it's per unit of area, per unit of cross area. And so you see that is per square meters, Ampere per square meters. And if I want to do that, nothing is easier. You simply have to multiply by the charge.

Again with this stupid example that I'm imagining some molecules of smoke and this... and there is some wind that is pushing them in one direction. If they are all charged, I have to multiply... if I have the flux, in order to get the current density, I have to multiply by the total charge. And in this case, I have to multiply by the charge of an element. If the element is a particle, I have to multiply by the elementary charge. Maybe the valency here. Maybe here I should write also $z$. But if I have moles, then I have to multiply by the charge of a mole. And if a mole is made of $6$ point something, $10^{23}$ particles, then okay, each particle will be charged $Q$, and I do the Avogadro number times $Q$, which is incidentally called **Faraday's constant ($F$)**, which is the amount of Coulomb per mole.

Nothing to understand here. It's simply that if you want to go to the world of electrical phenomena, electrical currents, you need to give this label to the particles. And depending on your choice, if you are in the... if you're in the... in the physicist quarter and you like densities, multiply by the elementary charge. But if you are in the moles, you have to multiply by the Faraday constant. And we will love to stay with concentration simply because it's so easy to prepare solutions and work with concentration.

So remember it will be at some point, although for a very brief moment of time, but at least now you know that the world of electronics is... could be reconciled with the world of particles swimming in a solution... ions. Because after all, ions are charge carriers. So maybe they can bring currents if they move in solutions. And that's why my neurons are firing and they generate electrical phenomena, because it's the same thing. But they're not electrons.

And actually it's even more interesting because in the... you know that electrons and even holes are in semiconductors or only metals are the only charge carriers. In electrolytes, in biological solutions, you have a multitude of charge carriers. You have magnesium, you have chloride, you have sodium, you have potassium, you have *chlorine*, you have many other ions that if they are in solution they might be positively or negatively charged just purely because of the dissociation due to water, to the properties of the permittivity of the water. So it's the same thing. And here basically we are reconsidering, we are approaching the elementary bit. We already kind of revisited the potential and now the current. So basically Kirchhoff is our friend now because we... we know that Kirchhoff laws of current and voltages... okay here are the same... currents... okay current densities... and voltages.

### Two Types of Fluxes: Drift and Diffusion

And now the interesting bits. What kind of fluxes can occur in solution? Because after all, okay, fine, this can be an arbitrary function that is very elegant mathematically but... but okay, what could it be? There can be only two types that we are going to consider. One is if the particles are electrically charged and there are electric fields, electric force fields, they are basically Coulomb electrostatic interactions. And the other kind is **diffusion**.

So that's why here there is a waterfall, because the waterfall is a **drift flux**. There is gravitation that is pulling the particles. Okay, here the particles are not electrically charged but they have a mass so it's a similar thing and they are pushed in this direction. Here you have smoke and the smoke is diffusing. There is a lot of smoke here so immediately the concentration of smoke here will be high. But after a while, just purely by thermal agitation, and by bumping in air molecules or water molecules, the ink, I'm thinking of an ink in a glass of water, or the molecules of the smoke in air, will basically diffuse. And if you wait long enough, they will be everywhere equally diffused. Unless they might interact. But normally, smoke particles, they do not interact among themselves.

If they are ions and they are unequally distributed, maybe they do both. They could diffuse, but as they diffuse purely by, again, thermal agitation, they are too much concentrated here, so randomly they would go in all random directions, but the net flux would be that they would diffuse away from the point they were concentrated. But they are the ions that were going to the cinema, so they were, for instance, if they are all with the same charge, they will start to repel. So there will be some sort of combination between diffusion and drift. And if you have not just one, but you have maybe two or three or four or $n$ types of charge carriers, things may start being interesting because they will be, each will diffuse, but they will interact with each other by electrostatic forces.

To make a long story short, we cannot easily understand how these two things combined would give rise to this $-70 \text{ millivolt}$ because over there there is the... the answer to our problem. And so we are now using this... this framework. We know how to define fluxes. This is... I told you already the diffusive and drift fluxes.

#### 1. Drift Flux

Let me consider the **drift flux**. Somehow it's easier mathematically. So I'm considering, of course, charged particles, otherwise there is no point. Coulomb will not give me any satisfaction. Coulomb only holds when the particles have this physical property that we call charge. But allow me to assume that they are uniformly distributed. So they are everywhere the same, so there is no diffusion. They might stay in solution at $37$ degrees, but overall, statistically, they will not move. What they do, they will repel and attract each other.

But let me make it easier. I'm thinking that there is an external force, and this external force, I told you, that can be related to charges by the knowledge of the electric fields. And if... since I don't like working with vectors, instead of $E$ I work with minus the gradient of the potential. So the external force acting on a certain charge with a valency that can be $2$ in case of calcium... so is the amount of charge times the electric field. Or the amount of charge with the minus... the gradient of the potential. This is the specific force field that I would like to obsess now.

So here if you like working in the... in the world of densities, and so here is $Q$ is the elementary charge of a proton and $z$ will be $2$ say for calcium, will be $1$ for sodium, will be $1$ again for potassium because they dissociate and they have unitary valency. If you like, like I do, working in the domain of concentrations, nothing easier. So this is a force, still it's Newton, but what I have to address is that I have to refer the force field or minus the... and I wonder why there is no minus here... why there is no minus? Okay, later... Avogadro number times the charge of the individual particles. So this is $z$ times the Faraday constant. And this is going to be multiplied by the gradient of the potential. Minus. Minus. And here there is the minus. So here is no minus. So I'm losing minuses, but then they reappear magically for some magical property. Apologies, I will amend the slide tonight. And I will re-upload it correctly.

So now that I have the force field, and okay, depending on which is your favorite team, I can deal with it. Let me plug it in this expression of the flux. Nothing easier. You have the mobility. You have the concentration (because I'm working in this framework). And here is the force. Of course, it's the force related to the concentration world. So it's the, let me see here. So it's $-z$... minus, and then $N_A \times Q$ is the Faraday constant. So this is the total charge. So this is Coulomb. And this is because the Coulomb... the electrical force, is a conservative force.

So, okay, it's basically done. Don't worry about the story. I think that you will not be tempted to, you will not have the urge to consider Faraday constant as Coulomb per mole. If you do, we can talk about that, but I think that that will be okay.

So this has the same unit of a flux. That means moles per square meters per second. It's not a current density. It's just the flow of particles. If you want to make them into a current density, you have additionally to multiply by $zF$, but we don't do it for the moment.

Why am I doing this? Because this flux is the flux of matter. Fine, the matter is electrically charged, and these charged particles are moving because there is an electrostatic force. Fine, but this is measuring a flux of stuff. So it's like the flux of a river. So, so, passively and, sorry, positively and negatively charged, they experience a force, and this force here I basically put it in relationship in a monodimensional case with the electrostatic potential.

What I'm trying to go... so where I'm trying to go is the following. To give you a slight bit of intuition. I have a cell and I have this electrostatic potential $V$ that I told you is negative with respect to the reference electrode. So I have somewhere a potential that I measured. It's not something that I imposed. I measure a potential. So I would love to translate, to relate electrical phenomena that are being characterized by potential to fluxes. Because intuitively I'm thinking that maybe there is something related to charges inside and outside and these charges, as opposed to what I did on the demo before, they are not glued in place. These are glued in place. See what happens if I put a positive charge, the negative is not... is... It should be kissing the negative. Instead, they are not attractive. They are glued on the table. If instead I put these, it became now proverbial. So the sodium very close to another *peer* in the cinema, they're not repelling each other. These are, just for the sake of simplicity, these are *stick*, they're glued on a table.

But in solution, everything moves. So I hope that maybe if things are moving, I can describe fluxes. And if I can describe fluxes, I can maybe sort of understand if there is any relationship between fluxes and potential. Maybe, even ambitiously, some relationship which is self-consistent. There is no external force. It's just the thing that is reorganizing, redistributing, because things are... maybe initially they're not equal inside and outside, and if they're not equal they will start giving rise to fluxes, and the fluxes are going to create an equal distribution, there will be repulsion or attraction, and at some point, $-70 \text{ millivolts}$ will come up. This is my plan. It's not entirely correct, but it's almost what we are going to do. It's not exactly how things will work.

#### 2. Diffusive Flux

Let me show you this animation and then we break for $10$ minutes.

If you don't have any electrostatic charge, any electrical charge, so they are not charged particles, they are in aqueous solutions and they are unequally distributed. Because otherwise if you kill me also for the distribution, so they are not interesting, they are not spicy. They are not charged. And everywhere is the same. Well, they don't do anything interesting.

Here you know that if they are in solution and they are not charged, they **diffuse**. Diffusion is omnipresent. So the ink in water, the smoke. And this happens because you know that there is thermal agitation, so non-zero kinetic energy of water dipoles. They are constantly agitated and they bump into each other. And they do this because they are not at $0 \text{ degree Kelvin}$ and so there is thermal agitation. And by doing this they transfer kinetic energy to the... to the particles, to the calcium ions for instance. And they do this by random isotropic collisions. Isotropic means that there is no preferred direction. So it's the same. So a dipole would bump me from the bottom or from the top or from the left to the right, it's gonna be the same. I will randomly make a step.

Probably you heard in this context the analogy with a drunk sailor... *sailor man* that is drunk and it can be... just because it's drunk he can make a step on the right or a step on the left. If it is a mono-dimensional *sailor... sailor man*, it will go randomly from one direction or the other. Here I'm basically thinking of the underlining things and this very fantastic... I will at some point I will make it nicer. This is a stupid cartoon that I made, not really implementing the diffusion equation. The diffusion equation is something that I would like to derive. The only thing that I... so here it's what it's called the Monte Carlo simulation where I'm basically considering the microscopic scale and microscopic phenomena. And here the microscopic phenomena is that they are only bumping and making random movements. In other words, I don't know whether you have ever heard of this, this is the so-called **Langevin equation**. So the actual stochastic bumps are translated into a force field that is just a random number generator in a computer.

If they start all concentrated in one spot, purely by this random, and believe me I did it, there is no direction that is preferred, you have that they were all in one spot at time zero and now they tend to be distributing everywhere in the *same* in space. This is a box so there are boundary conditions so you see that particles are not allowed to escape. And this red and blue lines are basically histograms of the horizontal and vertical coordinates. If at the time zero there were two Dirac deltas because they were all concentrated in one spot, at $t$ that goes to infinity they should go flat. So this is the concentration somehow, and the concentration should be the same everywhere. You see they did not stop moving but statistically their overall population did not change. The only difference is that they are boundary conditions so you have these two spikes at the *other* boundaries because yeah, I cannot... I make a random... if I'm here I'm only... I can only make a random step on the left because if I make a random step on the right, I hit the wall. So there it's a restricted diffusion, so you have this anomalies compared to what the diffusion equation would predict. But here there is no diffusion equation.

But the question is, after the break, can I make the flux? Can I understand how do I have to write the flux? Because here it's a bit complicated, I leave you to think of it. What is the force field in a diffusive environment. There is no... well there is a force because things started *to* move around, but what is the force field? Is it conservative?

Let's stop for $10$ minutes.

Okay. Okay, let me restart.

So this slide is a bit dense and there is one concept that I cannot make it... I cannot make it easier for you and so it's a bit disappointing for me because I wanted to show you the steps as I derived the drift flux. And in the case of the diffusion, as this is not a course in thermodynamics, I cannot come with a... because this involves statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, I cannot easily tell you what is the force field and what is the potential that is associated to the force field in the context of a diffusion.

So the elements that I clearly intuitively are there is that temperature has to play a role. So the warmer the bath, the faster is the... So the higher is the kinetic energy. So the story of the kinetic energy, which is clearly well represented in a statistical mechanical representation of thermal phenomena, is there. And the other concept that is there is the concentration. So this is something related to the concentration. If things are *unequally* distributed, then there is some sort of net force, even though the elementary forces are random and isotropic.

So this is sort of given. It follows from other principles that when you have temperature that is larger than zero, so you have non-zero kinetic energy of the water molecules, and kinetic energy is exchanged, it is as if you have an external force field which depends on the temperature. $k$ is the Boltzmann constant. And then there is this funny gradient of the logarithm of the concentration. So the two elements are there. The temperature is there and the concentration is there. And okay, the temperature, I'm happy that is here, that is proportional, so I double the temperature this force seems to double so that, okay, it could be intuitive. What it's not intuitive at all is why this has to be this potential... so minus the gradient of this function, $\log(C)$, with respect to space. But this is the potential of the force field, how this is came to be. And of course it's also more complicated to state, oh okay, so a potential exists, so the equivalent force field is conservative, but I don't venture in that concept.

So this is the exact same case for the world of densities. If you are in the world of concentrations, this is a force that has to be scaled to an Avogadro number of particles, so this Boltzmann constant has to be pre-multiplied by the Avogadro number. And you end up having this $N_A \times k$ which is called $R$ which is also called **gas constant**... is given the final expression.

So the flux was: mobility $\times$ concentration $\times$ the external force.
$J = u \cdot C \cdot F$
So the external force here is $-RT$, and then is the gradient of the logarithm of the concentration. With respect to $r$ or $x$ or whatever you want to call it. So just this... just this unidirectional, just monodimensional case. Let's call this coordinate $x$.

Something that you might be tempted to do is that here this seems to be a composite function and the derivative of the logarithm of a concentration. So this concentration we don't know what it is. It's a given or maybe becomes self-consistent but that will be later. So here you will be tempted to simplify this term. Would you tell me how? How can I rewrite this? *Analisi 1*.

Okay. $1/C$, $dC/dx$. Indeed. And you will see that $C$ is simplifying, is canceling. And I hope that you have seen this expression because this is the law of diffusion. I think it's in the next slide, but I want to just, I cannot resist simplifying this. So you have that diffusion is proportional to the gradient, which is exactly what diffusion is. Okay, yeah, I'm spoiling even myself.

#### Fick's Law of Diffusion

So if I do that, you see there is no longer concentration here multiplying because it has been simplified. And apart from these quantities that are constant, and maybe I call them big $D$, I call it just... it's a number. Then I have that:
$J = -D \cdot (dC/dx)$
So the minus comes from the idea of the... of the potential. And you know this as the **Fick's law**. I think it's Fick's law of diffusion.

If you have a profile of concentration that is like this, so moving in this direction in this coordinate you have a lot of stuff, so it's a pile of sand. Okay, if you move from left to right you encounter the pile of sand, so the more you move to the... to the... to the right the more stuff you find, the more concentrated it is. Well, you know that the pile, if it should fall or if it's not a pile it's maybe smoke or ink or whatever, will tend to diffuse from points where they have higher concentration to points that have lower concentration. To me this is a pile of sand that when it relaxes it ejects sand in this direction. It doesn't eject because that would mean spending energy to become more concentrated. So if I have nothing and then at some point I have all the ink in a glass of water, the ink will diffuse in the opposite, so this minus direction of where the concentration is increasing. The derivative of the concentration with respect to space is where the concentration is increasing. Minus is where it's decreasing. This is the law of the diffusion that you probably have seen many times, I hope in the past. It's called the Fick's law of diffusion.

And the fact that people could link this microscopic thermodynamical constant, $R$, $T$, particularly $T$, the temperature, and the mobility to this **diffusion coefficient $D$**, which is exactly what people have been measuring for decades and centuries for quantifying diffusion of particles, the diffusion of that ionic species or that molecule or hemoglobin, so whatever... oxygen... $D$ has been related, and this is due to **Einstein**. So Einstein worked out, as you probably know, the link between the microscopic mechanism, the microscopic view of Brownian motion, the thermal agitation, to its macroscopic description, which is here. Here you don't have anymore the single molecule. Here you have the single molecule, the particle... okay here you have a mole of particles. Here you don't, you don't have anymore the microscopic, you don't have the kinetic energy. So it's very powerful synthesis in a way and it's exactly what we want, what we need, because now we have diffusion and drift. Sometimes we are going to simplify that, some other times it's easier to work with the... with this full expression. It can be ugly but it's not particularly difficult now that I guide you and I gave you perhaps intuition to what this thing is. It was as expected, it had to depend on the concentration.

So you have drift and diffusion and the question now will be what do I do with this? What do I do with this knowledge?

I think we are... I don't remember this quiz or questions or whatever. Okay, so this is exactly the point. What happens if you have both? Particles that are charged and they are non-uniformly concentrated. They will both drift and diffuse. The point is that it's not trivial and it's very difficult unless maybe you could think of running a computer simulation to understand how... there will be a Monte Carlo simulation where you track individual things, how they would tend to diffuse because they are too packed, but if they are diffusing they are getting further away from their opposite charge friend and they will be kind of being attracted. But if they are attracted too much, then they will start igniting diffusion. So there will be this sort of ping-pong, maybe some sort of equilibrium, balance between these two things.

So balance would mean what? That this is exactly equals to that? Or maybe... maybe it's a thermodynamical equilibrium that means that everything is dead. So there is no flux. This is zero, this is zero. Maybe the sum is going to be zero. We're going to see that this is the way to understand why this is $-70 \text{ millivolts}$. The whole story is if they are free to move, then it's not what your intuition might have guided you in at the beginning or... or last week to say, "$-70 \text{ millivolt}$, well superposition of the effect, it's because I have a lot of negatively charged particles inside." Which incidentally is in part, it's true, it's not wrong, but it's not the reason why you have this electrostatic potential. And by the way, it's not... otherwise would not be explainable why this electrostatic potential can even change abruptly in excitable cells.

Something that, of course, has happened is that in the video, the last couple of hours there was no projection of the slides, but at least the slides you have them. Now I think I solved it. I have now understood where a bug is, but at least you have blackboard material and my voice.

### Neuroelectronics: The Real Thing

So let's continue with this chapter that is not any more preliminaries. Now it's the real thing, it's **neuroelectronics**. And I hope that now it makes sense why is electronics. It's about current, current densities, fluxes, electrostatic potentials, distributions. Not too far from what maybe some of you might have studied in the case of semiconductors, diodes, transistors, is similar, it's not so different.

So, again, as a supporting means to your study and understanding, these are the references that might be relevant for this part. Particularly both in this book and in this book, it's just one or two chapters. It's not the entire book. Instead, here you have way more stuff, more chapters are related to diffusion, drift, to the emergence of electrostatic potential across a biological membrane and how this is affected by membrane properties. And this is also another relatively general introduction on the cellular biophysics, at least the first couple of chapters.

So this is a list. It's what we are going... I don't know whether we are finishing today, most likely we are continuing next week. Let me for a moment focus on the first three things. So I would like to make it even more explicit that we are focusing on wet systems, so aqueous solutions that have electrochemical properties. So they have electrolytes, so they have ions and cations, which is just another convention to say if these are positively charged *or* negatively charged, unless I'm swapping them. They are particles that are charged and they are ionic species and they are born, they come from the dissociation of molecules in water. And again I will tell you how we do measure the electrostatic potential by electrodes, particularly with one electrode interface which is silver chloride, silver chlorinated interface.

And again I will again emphasize that our task is this tackling this $-70 \text{ mV}$ under rest, resting. What is rest? It's rest but I'm still alive, so maybe it's not thermodynamical equilibrium. And at rest I do have $-70 \text{ mV}$. For excitable cells, sometimes in a matter of less than a millisecond this electrostatic potential jumps $100 \text{ mV}$. So something here, or maybe not, or maybe something has to change rapidly over a time scale of a millisecond, or maybe not. And then I will go with other things. So I will refresh, I will tell again the superposition of the effects, I will tell that the anchor charges are fine for intuition but they are not what happens, and again drift and diffuse and I will tell you what, why, how do we use it.

Okay, first three parts.

So I'm thinking now of a world where you have aqueous solution, so you have a solvent and the solute is made of molecules that are charged. They might even be not charged. And they are, yeah, these are the ions that we are probably going to comment mostly. And they dissociate because salt, because of solvation, is this reversible reaction that happens because in water electrostatic forces are weaker. And obviously, this is an important thing. Remember that **electroneutrality** always holds, globally. Locally, it might be violated. But globally, if I put one gram of sodium chloride in one liter of water, it's going to be electrically neutral. But it will be dissociated, so in some spot I can observe electrostatic potentials that are non-zero.

This is for the tenth time. In metals you have some charge carriers, in solution you have a multiplicity of charge carriers. And there is no particular novelty to tell you that people started observing many, many years ago, $50$ years ago or more, the comparison between transistors and electrolytes, even proteins and semiconductors. However we are going a little bit more in details, more in depth, and we are going basically to study electrochemical system with electrodes. And just for... For the nomenclature, it depends on the book that you look. You have anodes and cathodes, particularly when you have, maybe not only you measure, this is supposed to be some sort of gauge, just to measure what is the difference of potential between these two points of the solution. Or maybe you want to apply an electrical potential with a battery, an electromotive force, and you make, let's say, the positive or negative electrodes are going to accumulate the opposite sign particles to that electrode. So this is the framework that we are considering.

#### Electrodes: The Silver/Silver-Chloride ($\text{Ag/AgCl}$) Interface

And about electrodes, I have immediately to tell you that like what I *tried* to stick on my chest and on my arm during the first class, we cannot use metal, a piece of metal. Well, we could, but it's different. Because electrons are not going to jump into the solution and ions are not going to be entering in the crystalline *reticulum* of a metal and will be kind of fighting and kind of finding their way in the metal wire. This is not going to be happening.

What people did, and this is the most conventional and the easiest kind of electrode to be used and to be understood, although as you can see is the most fragile, and it's definitely not the one that Elon Musk is placing, it's not the way Elon Musk is placing electrodes permanently in the brain of patients, it's called **silver chloride junction**. And it's based on this dissociation reaction. If you take silver and you put it in a solution that is very rich of *chlorine* ions, *Chlorine* and silver can bond together, can bind together, and in the process they release an electron. Because charge has to be conserved, and this electron, if by chance you have an electric wire that is closing a circuit, maybe to another electrode, through a meter or through an amplifier, so you close the circuit, this electron could or can give rise to a measurable electrical current. So an ionic current, these *chlorine* ions getting closed and binding, give rise to an ion.

So this is the perfect interface to exchange. It's like when you go to a foreign country and you have different currency, you want to pay with Euros and they only accept Swedish Crowns. Well, okay, this is making the conversion and so it's transparent to you. It's so transparent that this is an **ohmic interface** in the sense that there is proportionality between the difference of potential and the current that flows in.

Also, the opposite takes place. So again, charge is conserved if you have a block of silver that is bound mechanically or because you kept it in solution for many hours, or because it's produced by an industrial process that is called *sinterization*, that is attaching *chlorine* to the porous structure of silver, you make it porous. If you pass a current, like the battery that I was attaching a moment before in the previous slide, if you pass a current, then you may create a dissociation of *chlorine* ions that were attached to the silver metal, and they are expelled, and they are now free to swim in solution.

So it works as an interface, as a bidirectional interface, and that's why placed on my skin you could get signals, and if you attach electrodes to my brain and you apply some sort of electric current, you can excite my cells because you can create some fluxes, some current densities in terms of fluxes of ions. Although you start only with electrons. So you can measure and you can inject, read, write. And this read and write is linear in the sense that it is linear, it's an ohmic relationship. So if you apply with respect to the solution you apply a certain electric potential, electrostatic potential, the current will be proportional to how intense is the electrostatic potential.

Again please remember this the comparison with the gravitational potential. If I have two *reservoirs* of liquid, I don't know whether this helps or confuse you, if you have two *reservoirs* made full of liquid, full of whatever... wine or petrol or water whatever... and you are making their height, you create a difference of electrostatic potential. The electrostatic potential is basically referred to the height. So if they are not at the same height but one is higher than the other, then you will create the condition for a current, for a flux to flow from one container to the other. Here is the same concept and it's a ohmic relationship. Of course there is resistance because there is non-ideal, not perfect, it's not a superconductor, it's not a perfect match, one electron, well it is one electron, one *chlorine* but the... clearly resistance in the wire because it's not an ideal wire and there is a resistance... Stokes law... in the solution.

If you have sodium hypochlorite... so if you have *candeggina* at your place and you have a piece of metal wire... well don't do that because you will... well it's not ruined but it's a... if you have a silver chain or silver ring if you put it in *candeggina* it will be immediately covered by a silver chlorinated layer. And this is how we build our electrodes in the lab. There are other ways that is by electro-deposition. So we apply a specific current, so it's here, and we make the *chlorine* attached to the... to silver. So we subtract current and we get as a result silver chlorinated electrodes.

#### Pipettes and Patch-Clamp

The other element I mentioned many times... the **pipettes**. This is a close view of one machine that we use in the lab to build these pipettes. So we start from borosilicate glass that we buy and they're very expensive and they are very tiny. It's a $1 \text{ millimeter}$ or *half a* millimeter diameter made of glass, borosilicate glass particularly. And if you ever seen *of*... being to Venice and the islands around Venice, you know that you can do by heat, you can melt the glass. So if you have this tube of glass... they got a Nobel Prize for this idea... and you put it in one part where there is a filament, I don't think that you see here, but there should be here a sort of ring, and this ring is attached to a battery so when current is flowing in, because the ring has some resistance, is going to heat up a lot. If you go with this capillary inside this ring in the center it will melt.

And if you mount all of this in a system that cost about $12,000 \text{ Euros}$... it's not very cheap... in a system that has some wires, this is another sort of pulley that is pulling the two extremities of, in this case it's an horizontal puller, it's called pipette puller with a lot of originality. So if you *hit* in the center and you start to pull, the glass is melting and getting softer and getting thinner. At some point where you pull with more force and you end up having from each side this melted and very, very, very tiny capillary. The other one remained from the other side of the system. Initially it was just a cylinder inserted in the middle with this ring, it was heated, pulled, heated, pulled in a certain cycle and at the end you end up having with a tip that can be smaller than a micrometer or even smaller.

And you're familiar with this because you see this in in-vitro fertilization of oocytes, of human oocytes, where people are injecting genetic material taken from men in the oocytes by some sort of pipette. This is obviously for different reasons. And what we use this, we put here inside a very, very tiny silver wire, silver chlorinated wire, silver that stayed in the *candeggina* for overnight and we fill the pipette with a solution that is very rich in *chlorine*. So at the tip of this pipette we have a perfect interface. So we have here... this is silver, this is silver chloride and so this is connected to an amplifier, to a system, to some sort of a battery or whatever, and at the very tip here we can basically count of *chlorine* ions to be our messengers. And if you have some sort of electrostatic phenomena in the bath, in the solution, in the stomach of a cell, I can really be bringing some sort of detector very, very close, and I will be guaranteed to be able to transduce this difference of potential, this current, into a world that I can manipulate with electrodes.

And again, when you do that, you put it under, okay, in this case you need a special contrast technique. I think I show you already this. What you do, you push it into the stomach of a cell, inside. Here there are many pipettes. There are six pipettes and six neurons. And what you see is the experimenter that is changing the focus. And when I say $-70 \text{ millivolt}$ I'm referring to what the tip of the pipette is detecting with respect to another electrode which is typically called pigtail because it's a... it's a piece of wire, it's... we don't need another pipette. And this piece of wire is just to expand its surface... keeping the surface... sorry, expand its exposed surface keeping the volume small... we wrap it around and it looks like the tail of a pig. Although pigs are... well I don't think they are so curly but still.

And so when I say $-70 \text{ mV}$ it means that the difference of potential inside minus outside is $-70$, is negative, because outside by convention I say that this is $0 \text{ millivolt}$. I attach this to the ground of my amplifier so I say that is... that is zero. And so that's why I'm basically saying inside the electrostatic potential is $-70$. Now in the... today and next week I will keep indicating *in* and *out*, but at some point I will maybe drop *out*, because for me *out* means out of the cell and means zero. So here it is *in* with respect to *out*. This is supposed to be the pigtail electrode. And this is the silver chlorinated with a very trivial, very crappy drawing, a very crappy scratch.

So I would like to understand from these first principles, from drift and diffusion, the existence of this difference of potential. And basically somehow I told you that this is not only theoretical, people are measuring it, we do it all the time, by this sort of electrodes and techniques.

### The Cell Membrane as a Capacitor

And the first things that we might have to encounter is a brief discussion of what the membrane is. Because I understand that I can pinch with a pipette because nowadays I have microscopy techniques that allows me to roughly see the boundaries of the cell. I will not be able to see how thick is the membrane, but I'm able to see whether I'm pinching or not, like for oocytes. And so it might be interesting to see whether this is ringing any bell. That is something that we already know.

And the interesting thing is that these endeavours towards this $-70 \text{ mV}$ will ultimately be resolved in terms of the permeability of fluxes and ionic permeabilities. Permeabilities are relatives of mobilities and they are related to the fact that the doors are small, they're large, they're closed, they're open. So basically it's only in terms of this selective ionic permeability and ionic flows that I can understand this neuroelectronic world.

In the process, we are going to end up having a fully **electrical equivalent model** of a membrane and of the cell and of the doors and etc. Which is very useful because not only we can say that we understand better a system, an electrical system that we are maybe familiar with. I mentioned in the past hours, Kirchhoff laws of current and voltages. So all this set of things of linear network theory, electrical network theory, that is very easy, very conventional. I might review it for some of you who might be completely empty. But say you have something that it's not obviously the physical system, it's a model. And having models is essential, like it is for a civil engineer, wants to build a bridge. You don't try to build a bridge and see what happens. You have a model, you have equations, you try to combine it, and then you make predictions and you build your system on the basis of these guidance. And you will see how naturally this electrical equivalent model will come.

And this is basically where we are going. So we are interested in excitability. What is, in all the things that I said before, what makes it possible for the membrane potential to change so rapidly, and apparently with some meaning. So not only the resting potential, again, the potential at rest, rest without any stimulus maybe, rest because you are resting, you are not consuming power maybe, but you're not dead, you're at rest. And here there are electrical potentials that are maybe conveying some action. And that's why they are called **action potentials**. They are also called **spikes** because they look like needles, like spikes, like spiky... *punte*, *spilli*. And they are faster. So this is-- I show you already many times this particular recording. Let's go on.

We measure this $-70 \text{ millivolts}$ across the cell. So inside with respect to the outside. And I hope that you had a happy childhood and you played at least once in your life with oil in water. I don't know whether you had a dish or you had a glass. You probably know that oil in water does interesting thing. It basically creates some sort of spheres or circles and it's not mixing because the molecules of oil are **hydrophobic**. It always takes me a couple of milliseconds to remember what is hydrophobic and hydrophilic. Hydrophobic, I imagine, is particles of oil. They are phobic, they have a phobia for water, but it's because of this phobia that they are creating these phases. And that's why, thanks to this, that life evolved. Again, you needed to create some boundary from what is outside and what is inside. And this is the mechanism.

Of course, the membrane of a cell, of any cell, nerve cells or even pancreatic cells, muscle cells, skin cells, blood cells, white cells, is not only composed of lipids, of oily molecules. There are many, many other things interleaved into the membrane, but the properties that I'm referring to are basically mostly made of **phospholipids**. And these phospholipids, I'm just spending one word, you have only to vaguely remember that they have a **head** and they have **tails**, and the head is **hydrophilic**. Instead the tails are **hydrophobic**. And just purely by this electrostatic interaction with water dipoles, I don't have any more water dipoles around, these things thrown into the water, they **self-assemble** in membranes, which is to me mind-blowing. So you engineer something according to the rules of the game, which is physics and electrostatics, you put the ingredients there and out of the blue the lowest energy configuration is the one that creates a compartment inside divided from the outside.

Those using hydrating creams probably know that there are two kinds of stable configuration that lipids could get in water. One is what they are called *micelle*, **micelles**, where all the tails are pointing in and all the heads, hydrophilic heads, are pointing out. So they are basically shielding what they, so the tails really don't like to be in contact with water, so they try to really to escape. And they are, sometimes they are used in cosmetic products, they are very common to see this. And another very common for hydration creams is **liposomes**, also for drug delivery. So I'm just making it trivial, assuming that you never heard of liposomes, in which you have that there is another configuration in which it forms, a **double layer** is formed. So the tails are facing each other and there is an internal compartment that is formed as well. And this is the most interesting part because this double layer, phospholipid double layer, is stable. And this is what generally, just on a first approximation, constitutes a plasmatic membrane.

And the story that I told you about this very tiny, so it's a nanometer thick layer of the membrane, of this double layer, has been measured electrically. Because people started thinking, okay, there must be something, there must be a membrane. Well, this was the membrane hypothesis. And outside, I have a lot of ions. Ions are charged carriers. And then inside, I have a lot of charged carriers. So I have two compartments that are basically **conductors**. Not ideal conductors, but conductors. And in between, I have maybe something that does not allow water or other things to flow in. You see, it's very packed. It's like an army, like all soldiers. Okay, the army is a bit unhappy, comparison analogies, like a crowd, and they do not allow anything. And water cannot enter because, energetically, you will need a lot of energy to push a water dipole in, which opens an interesting reflection. If it takes a lot of energy to move something from inside to the outside, maybe something went wrong. This is not an ideal thing because I'm a cell, I need to eat. You also need to take coffee or whatever you can find from the machines here or whatever. You have to go in and out. You have to exchange even information. And if it's so difficult to enter and exit, maybe you need to have some, you have to devote some specific structures, *ad hoc* structures like doors, because going through the walls might require a bit of energy. You could do that if they push you, but it's going to be really, really costing.

But let me go back to this story that there is some conductor here, there is another conductor here, and this seems to be an **insulator**. Does it ring any bell? You have two, yeah, **capacitors**. I know that you are all experts in biophysics, but I hope that those of you who may not would maybe get this analogy. Of course, it's not a capacitor. It's definitely not a parallel planar plate capacitor. It's a biological membrane, but it behaves like, at least geometrically and also functionally, behaves like a capacitor.

So if I have, again, if I know how the electrostatic potential, particularly here, across these two plates is related to the charge, and I know that this is the basic definition of capacitance, $C = Q/V$, I know that maybe I can do, I'm in the game. So I know that for parallel plate capacitor that at some point... now this is a mathematical model. It's not the real thing, but it's useful and it's actually even beyond the good analogy. It works so nicely that if you take the formula that was derived in physics one whatever of the capacitance... like the ratio between the difference of charge or the change of charge maybe over time, let's say the difference of charge, the different distribution of charge and the difference of potential or the variation of the potential in time, then you can do this and you can understand maybe why you have $-70 \text{ millivolts}$ from inside with respect to the outside. Maybe you can guess what is the charge difference inside and outside if you know the value of the capacitance.

And the value of the capacitance is known from first principle to depend on the area ($A$). The larger the plates of this capacitor, the bigger is the capacitance, and the *closer* closely spaced are these plates (distance $d$), the higher is the capacitance. And you see here that there is the... is the permittivity. So it's the $\epsilon_0 \times \epsilon_r$. And I told you that for phospholipid *belayers* this is around seven.

So if you could, and this is how people did, if you could engineer just maybe not the real cell but if you could take this phospholipid and you can maybe put it say on water... you can assemble something that you know how large is the *surfaces* and you know the permittivity of the lipids. And you can measure electrically the capacitance. You can measure the capacitance injecting some current and seeing how the voltage is changing. So I'm thinking of the constitutive equation of a capacitor, which is $I = C \cdot (dV/dt)$. And I'm tempted to say that if I integrate both sides, I can get some sort of relationship between the voltage and the integral of the current. So if I can maybe inject some current, I can measure the voltage and I can infer the capacitance. This is one way. It's not for instance, it's not the way we do it today for measuring the capacitance of a real cell. We do it in a different way, but people did it and... and they got that it was around in the order of a few nanometers. And for me, this is brilliant.

So, one, you could calculate from first principle, okay, now you know the thickness and the permittivity, and so you can get the capacitance, or vice versa, like they did. You don't know the thickness, but you measure the capacitance. And so this is the formula that you would use. And if you are interested in the capacitance per area unit, so the so-called **specific capacitance**, I'm attached to this because I don't know how big a cell would be. It could be a small sphere or it could be a bigger sphere. I would love to have some value that is a specific physical quantity. So specific means per unit of area. And the number that you can burn into your brain, although in humans, in human cell, people found at least one paper found slightly different value that was half of this value... so it's **$1 \text{ }\mu\text{F/cm}^2$** (one microFarad per square centimeter).

So you see it's per square centimeter. So the total capacitance is... will be known if you specify the area, otherwise it remains this specific quantity. And here you see I only use the nanometer... $6 \text{ nanometer}$... $10^{-9}$ because it's milli-micro-nano... so it's three... and $10^{-9}$. And here I think it's $8.85 \times 10^{-12} \text{ Farad per meter}$, this is $\epsilon_0$, and $7$ is the relative permittivity. And you get roughly for free that you get $1 \text{ microfarad}$ which is what you measured experimentally.

And something that you could do is you could get this $70 \text{ millivolt}$ interpreting this $\Delta V$ and $\Delta Q$ as the delta... as a difference in space. So with the two... so not necessarily in time but in... okay that's another story. And here you will see that if you plug the value of $1 \text{ microfarad per square centimeters}$ you can see that a membrane that is $70 \text{ millivolts}$ charged is actually storing this amount of current per unit of area. This is kind of interesting *per se*, it doesn't answer still my question saying, but why you have $-70 \text{ millivolts}$. Because here you have, this is given. You could also reason the opposite way. You say if this is a difference in electrical charge around the membrane, then you will have $-70 \text{ millivolt}$. Okay, but why? Why did you end up with this value of the charge? Nonetheless this knowledge that is basically taken from elementary physics or from electrical engineering allows you to make prediction, to make calculations, to make... to *deeper* your understanding of a biological system... of any cell by the way, not only *your*... of neurons. OK, in humans, people found a smaller value.

#### The Membrane as an RC Circuit

And you might remember that people are fond of studying **RC circuits**, where you not only have a capacitor, but you have a capacitor in parallel with a resistor, which is, by the way-- So this is an analogous to having your bathtub or your sink where you wash your face in the morning with a hole. So you have a certain height, and the height is equivalent to the potential that you have on the capacitor. And you have some dissipative system that here is represented by a leak that is contributing to removing the liquid. But anyway, to make a long story short, you probably know that this electrical circuit, for reasons that now I don't want to bother you with... in order to do that you have to derive the equation that describes $V$ as a function of all the other quantities, and you will find the usual boring differential equation, but you will find that the exponent that makes me happy, there is $e^{-t / (R \times C)}$. So the $RC$ of an RC circuit is the **time constant ($\tau$)**.

And so today we measure the capacitance by analyzing the time constant, the decay time constant of a real cell. Now it makes no sense because you would say, "Yeah, okay, but here there is a membrane. Where is the leak?" Okay, maybe you intuitively could say, okay so it's not only the membrane, there is... there are some resistors. And there are some resistors and so even if we don't know necessarily the value of the resistor, in one measurement we can see how fast or slow the system is relaxing and we get... we measure the capacitance. But in the old days they did it in a... in a different way because they did not have any... they did not play necessarily with intact cells or they did not play with cells like neurons. They do have resistors.

Let me skip this and let me, before breaking, let me just remember what I wanted to tell you. Okay, this I told you already. And so with this, I wanted to show you two graphs... This is the demo, I did it already, so you can go, you have the link if you want to play once. But I wanted to show you what I did having fixed, glue, anchored charges in free space, at least in a *B-dimensional* settings.

So, I tried to answer this question, and what I did is I myself randomly, so it's a *B-dimensional* system. I have one part of the plane that I call outside, I have one part that I call inside, and I dispersed here inside and outside positively or negatively charged ions. So it's me clicking and I did that, I did this. So negative, you see there are many negative inside and there are very fewer negative outside. And I put a little bit of, I sprinkled a little bit of positively charged ions. I know I should do it. This sucks. Graphically is not very appealing but I didn't have time and today one could think of doing these things with a... with a Python library that is called Manim. If you are fond of YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown, whatever. So he's actually using this library for making beautiful animation.

Okay I'm not so skilled but I wanted to do the following: if I have a certain distribution of charge then for every point I could measure all the distances and I can calculate the potential in that point. And here is what I did. Clearly you have... you have a sort of thermal map. You have in every point you have a color with a gradient scale that tells if the potential is positive or negative. Now forget about the unit. I... I only care about the negative or positive. Here I actually put random number for distances. I put random numbers for the charge. I did not expect to actually get $-80$ or $-70$. I just wanted to see if... now the question is, so you see the potential is negative inside and it's positive outside. But what I'm measuring with the pipette is a **difference**. So I put the pipette here and I put the other reference electrode here and I take the difference. Here you cannot see, so let me convert this into... Okay, here you are seeing it. So from this point to this point, the difference is $-42$. Okay, so the point is it's not the absolute values, it's the difference that should go to $-70 \text{ millivolts}$.

And if you do it in 3D, maybe it's easier. Inside you have this negative potential and outside they are positive. So this height should be $-70 \text{ millivolts}$ negative. So here should be lower than here. So when you take the difference you have something that is already minus, minus something that is positive so it remains minus. So here you would be... you would be tempted to conclude, okay, that's the explanation. That's why you have $-70 \text{ millivolts}$. You have a lot of negative charges inside.

Let me show what happens and then we break. Sorry that I'm abusing a few more minutes and we stop early. I will not do another $50$ minutes later.

If I put a lot of positively charged ions only outside, very little inside... so this is the dual case. Intuitively I like to think $-70$ it's negative. In reality is the difference between inside and outside. And this difference would still give rise to negative numbers if I have not only a lot of negative inside and a lot of positive outside, but also if I have a lot of positive outside and little positive inside. So the difference, the height, will still be negative. So you would have the same explanation for an unequal distribution of positive ions. So you will be at square one. Why the hell you have $-70 \text{ millivolts}$?

The problem is **anchored charges** and I hope that I did not spoil but in the past two hours I gave you some elements where we are heading, otherwise it would be too boring even if with some culmination in a moment, well probably next week.

So we break for $10$ minutes and we continue until 5:45.

Okay, so there are two key points. The first is that ions are not anchored, they are not stuck, they are free to swim, free to diffuse and to drift, to experience drift forces due to their own electric fields. And the other element is that there is a very thin insulating membrane across which we measure the electrostatic potential, the **transmembrane potential**. Transmembrane because it's across the membrane, inside with respect to the outside.

And what I wrote here is again the concept of capacitors. Capacitors are, the formal definition I think is that you have a set of coupled conductors where the distribution of charge and the distribution of electrostatic potentials are linked, are linked by a property that is called capacitance. And if you can think of this relationship and you divide both terms by $\Delta t$, so you're thinking of this change as a change over time, maybe you will recognize that here $\Delta Q / \Delta t$ is a charge divided by time, is a **current**. So somehow the two elements, the two worlds, the two concepts, currents, current densities... Okay, fluxes, but say this is basically currents and capacitance, capacitors that are able to integrate currents in order to generate the potential are the ingredients that we are, as electronic engineers or whoever we are familiar with. If not, I tell you these are very powerful concepts. And it took centuries to get to this relatively simple and elementary picture. Of course it's not over because it's not so trivial now to combine everything and to say, "Okay, so tell me how $V$ comes up." So maybe I tell you, apologies that this is capacitance, maybe I call it with this symbol, is that these ones are concentrations. These are concentrations.

So, summary of the facts.
1.  Everything is isopotential, but locally you can lose the electroneutrality.
2.  You have multiple ionic species.
3.  These ionic species, although we don't really understand how, but they must be unequally distributed inside and outside, otherwise we would not have, we would have no electrostatic potential.
4.  And the membrane *belayer* is impermeable to water and ions, so it is acting as a capacitor, as an integrator of current.
5.  And okay, this membrane potential that we measure, again, remember it's a difference of potential inside with respect to the outside, and the outside we consider zero.
6.  And again if the cell is not dead, and I'm repeating over and over again so there is no thermodynamical equilibrium... and you will hate me in a moment because in a moment I'm going to take this as an hypothesis at least temporarily... but say if I'm not dead it's $-70 \text{ millivolts}$.
7.  And in excitable cells things are even more interesting, more spicy. This changes, it goes $-70$ to $+30$ and back.

#### Ionic Concentrations

So first I start with telling you what people did in terms of quantifying the ionic concentrations inside and outside cells, starting from the most famous experimental preparation that is the **giant axon of the squid**. So there is a squid which is this invertebrate that you may have eaten, maybe it's a small one. So it's a giant axon... this guy here, if you dissect it, has a very big thing that is a cell that you can possibly put an electrode inside and you can measure things inside and outside. It's not the axon of the *giant* squid. The giant squid is a marine monster, probably it exists, it's very rare, but this has not been done on marine monsters. It has been done on squid, normal, but they have a big axon.

And this is the situation expressed in millimolar:
* **Potassium ($\text{K}^+$)** is concentrated a lot **inside** ($400 \text{ mM}$), and not that much outside ($20 \text{ mM}$).
* **Sodium ($\text{Na}^+$)** is the **opposite**. Sodium, you have a lot of sodium **outside** ($440 \text{ mM}$) and a little bit of sodium inside ($50 \text{ mM}$).
* **Chloride ($\text{Cl}^-$)** is like sodium, you have a lot of *chlorine* **outside** ($560 \text{ mM}$) and a little bit inside ($52 \text{ mM}$).
* And basically **Calcium ($\text{Ca}^{2+}$)** is very important because basically calcium is outside, there is a little bit ($10 \text{ mM}$), but **inside** basically it's almost **empty** ($10^{-4} \text{ mM}$). You heard probably at Nauseam in other courses that calcium intracellularly is considered a second messenger, is one of the most important actors in biochemical cascades. Well, it is because inside it's basically empty, so as soon as you start having some free calcium ions inside, the cell knows that it means something and it has mechanism to detect that.

Now I tell you something that I hope you will remember for the rest of your days, how to mnemonically remember these, because this is extremely important. In Italy it works nicely. Abroad I had to mention that I was Italian, that for lunch I was preparing pasta, which is the only thing of just a few things that I can cook. And in the water of pasta after, so before, well that's another thing, before or after water boils, I was putting sodium chloride. So, *sale da cucina*. Of course, it's not the only salt, but this is what I have at home and I put it in my boiling pan when I prepare pasta. So, if I taste this, it's salty, okay? It's trivial.

Now the disgusting part starts. In order to remember that outside you have a lot of sodium, so you have a lot of sodium chloride, allow me this, also it *also* for chloride. Imagine that you go... this is disgusting, but I could not find a better alternative. You will maybe propose me. So you go do, you do sport, you sweat a lot, and you lick your own sweat. It's salty, right? So closed... so outside the cell, presumably in the intercellular space. So this is inside and this is outside. In my perverse mind, the sweat is what is outside. So I lick my sweat, I lick and I taste it salty. I'm licking my *exacellular* medium, which is not wrong, of course. What is wrong is that by no means the other salts will taste differently to my tongue. But I hope that you will remember. So if I think, okay, I taste my sweat, it's salty, so it means that **outside I have a lot of sodium**. I have a lot of sodium and inside I have a little bit.

**Potassium is the opposite.** And you will tell me, have you ever tasted potassium chloride? No. I think it's not even... I don't know whether it's *eatable* if I take potassium chloride. I don't know. So potassium chloride is the opposite. You have very little potassium outside and a lot of potassium inside. Chloride, just because of the same story, goes like the sodium. So you lick, it tastes salty and that tastes salty because it's outside in the extracellular space you have a lot of ions.

It's important and we will see and it's intriguing that you were thinking, wait, I thought that you had a lot of negatively charged ions inside, but no, it seems that you have mostly positively charged ions, but you cannot really conclude what is what, because this guy here is $400 \text{ millimolar}$, it's a lot, and it's inside, instead sodium is $440 \text{ millimolar}$ outside. And we said that we should not take for granted the story of anchored, glued charges. So I don't think that we can conclude anything about this. But this is key for the next point.

#### The Role of Selective Permeability

The next point, so the spoiler, at the end, we are going to understand the electrical potential across the cell membrane because, okay, there is an heterogeneous distribution of charges. This we have understood. I think I repeat it too many times. And this, however, it's not enough. What matters is the fact that the **membrane is not permeable to all ionic species in the same way**. It's as if some of you would not be able to come out from the door, and the door would be only making those that are particularly slim or whatever... would be selective. So the permeability across the membrane is partial. And despite the fact that maybe you have, you see the most beautiful person from the other side, so you're attracted because you're blue or red. Okay, that's maybe not a good comparison. So you are attracted because of a drift or because of diffusion, yet you are not going to cross it because the membrane is not permeable.

And things are getting complicated because we are not talking about only one ionic species. There are multiple. The second point is that we are not talking about the thermodynamic equilibrium because you're not dead, but I will start with the dead cells. And because of these distinct concentrations. So the fact that you have a lot of sodium outside, it's a lot of sodium outside because if I lick my skin, it's salty. So it means outside the cells in the intercellular space, you have a lot of sodium and a lot of potassium inside instead is what makes these $-70 \text{ millivolts}$. So it's a collective thing.

This has been, for me, very complicated to appreciate intuitively. I can see why maybe if the charges are not anchored, if they are all concentrated unequally, say, there will be some diffusion, but then after diffusion, diffusing I will get far from my partner and then I will be attracted or repelled. So this I can feel. So there can be drift, diffusion, ping-pong, this I get it. What I don't get is, okay, but what does it matter? What does it mean that if you have a membrane that is semipermeable, then across the membrane you will have a difference of potential. So an unequal distribution say of positive and negatively charged.

So here I did the same cartoon that helped me. Not this one but something similar helped me. So again this is... it's purely a Monte Carlo simulation in the sense that I fake and I put the equation of motions so it's like a Langevin dynamics. There is no gravity. What I did here I only... if I remember correctly I only put... so I put friction of course, I put the random collisions so that I could get diffusion, and if I'm not mistaken I'm only taking care of attraction and not of repulsion. But definitely this is not what a proper molecular dynamical simulation would take into account. So if two particles are getting very, very close $1 / r^2$ will go to infinity. I don't have this and at some point I clip so that two particles can... can be one after the other. There are methods from physics where physicists already know how to do this system. But it was already computationally tough, although there are not many particles, to create a stupid movie like this.

So the difference is that we start with the same situation, that you have a lot of positively and negatively charged particles from one side of the membrane, and from the other side of the membrane you have almost nothing. In one case, which is this one, the membrane is as if it's not there. It's permeable. There is no selection. Here, black can cross, red will not. Red will stay on the left. And the numbers that you see below, if I'm not mistaken, are the number of black particles. We will see in a moment. So I launch the simulation and you will see what happens. And you can make a bet what happens after a sufficiently long amount of time what will be the distribution of the red or the black, whether they will be equally distributed or not.

You can see that here the red are crossing, here the red cannot cross. So it seems that because they stay here, they stay behind, the black will say, oh wait, you didn't come with me, then I'm attracted. I cannot, you don't come, you don't move the cloud, oh, sorry. I don't move the entire cloud, I don't move the entire cloud of things at once. Here it's as if the center of mass of this smoke cloud, the black and the red are basically diffusing and they are bringing each other. Here this cannot happen because the membrane is semipermeable. And this is the entire story.

So in a couple of seconds, or maybe $10$ seconds or $20$ seconds... this number here is the number of frames, the number of step of the simulation. It's something for me to show me that things were moving. Here, you end up having, I think it's the red. No, sorry, it cannot be the red, because otherwise it would be zero. So the black here will be $50/50$, because there is no selection. Here will not be $50/50$. And you can already appreciate it. OK, it's fluctuating because it is a stochastic simulation. It's a numerical simulation of a system that is, say, it's at the equilibrium, but in a statistical sense. But here you actually see that there is a so-called breaking symmetry, instead on the left. So the fact that the membrane is opposing the passage from one ionic species is enough to create an unequal distribution, a dynamical unequal distribution. So something has to do with membranes and something has to do with permeability, but I have no idea what permeability is. There I'm talking about fluxes in the open space, so there is no permeability. Okay, maybe I could imagine that the mobility, I could make the mobility at some point in some, although it's a property of the molecule, but I could maybe say at some point the mobility goes to zero. But it's not very elegant because it seems that I have to tweak something. In other words, electrically, I'm talking about that here, there is no resistance. So the current can flow in both directions. Here there is only... some ionic species have a non-infinite resistance. So here the resistance is zero, here for some ionic species selectively is infinite. So there you cannot change. Of course if it's not infinite but it's very large, still you would have this breaking of the symmetry.

#### Ion Channels, Pumps, and the Electrical Model

Okay. So the doors that I anticipated to you are physical doors, physical pores, and these pores are called **ionic channels**. I don't know whether in the module of Professor Zoli you have heard of something like this. Are proteins... they are called surface proteins just because they are expressed at the surface of the membrane. So you actually see here the double layer, the phospholipid double layer, *b-layer* whatever. And these proteins are not inside the cell, they're not outside, they stay in between. They stay in a part... in... in a domain that is called lipophilic, so it's philia for lipids. So... So they love being with lipids. And these proteins might have a different distribution of charge, of electrical charge, so that they are stable there. So you cannot pull them away unless using a big force. What they can do, they can slide horizontally on the surface of the membrane so much that this cartoon, this conceptual model, was called for many years, I think it's still called **fluid mosaic**. So the membrane is a collection of particles and structures, lipids, and it is as if they swim on the surface of the sea like kids when they have these inflatable things, *braccioli* or *salvagente*. Of course if you want to go down or up you have to spend a lot of energy and so naturally this does not happen.

But if these proteins are creating some sort of space in their inside due to their three-dimensional conformation, and if you are an ion, you can move freely or not freely inside the pore, then this is like a passage of ions across the membrane with a bridge, with an easy path that does not require a huge amount of energy like the lipid *belayer* would require this strain. And in fact our colleagues went through a pore and not through the walls.

So these are pores and it turns out that you have specific pores only permeable to sodium ions, they are called **sodium channels**, and you have pores that are only selective to potassium *channels*, that are called potassium ions, they are called **potassium channels**. You have *chlorine* ion channels, you have some ion channels that are permeable to all ionic species, and you have some other mechanism of transport, which they are not passive transport like these two cases, where you basically, if you have the energy to do that, or simply by purely diffusion, by purely thermal agitation, can go in and out without problem.

Of course if you have a $-70 \text{ millivolt}$ difference of potential across the membrane it means that you have an electric field, then it might be easy or difficult depending if you are positively or negatively charged ion species. Say for sodium ions will be very easy because ion is concentrated a lot outside (because I lick and I feel tasty and my *swept* is salty) and so it's positive. Inside is more negative than the outside. So I can move along the electrochemical gradient, the electrical gradient. Well it's also electrochemical because I have a lot of sodium outside and a little bit inside. So by diffusion as well as by drift I will be able, if I'm a sodium ion, I will be able to enter. If I'm inside will be more difficult because I will move against both the diffusion and the drift.

But this is still passive. There are active mechanisms, like I cited a couple of hours ago, called **ionic pumps**. And these ionic pumps, I imagine them like some sort of mechanism. And they have been described mechanistically like some sort of rotating things or machinery, molecular machinery, that are able to exchange against the electrochemical gradient. So for instance, sodium I told you it's very easy to flow in, but very difficult to get out. But if you have ATP, so if you eat your bananas and chocolate and you have adenosine 3-phosphate molecules that can be used as a currency for converting, so they are used for storage of energy, and you can spend this energy, you can activate from one cycle this ionic pump, and you can extrude three sodium ions, and you pull in two potassium ions. Remember that you have a lot of sodium ions outside and a lot of potassium ions inside. So this truly requires a lot of energy. It's not passive.

So this is important because these ionic pores or ionic channels, the pumps we will not probably consider. We will not discuss it in details anymore. But the ionic pumps are to me resembling a metal wire or a **resistor**. If I'm an ion, I can go along. There is a capacitor here, but this capacitor must be some sort of parallel between the capacitor and there are these resistors. Because if I'm an ion, I can, yes, I can impinge in the membrane here and I will hit the insulator. Okay, if I'm approaching here and I'm a positive ion, just by electrostatic induction, I will attract my opposite from the other side. But this is going to be only a so-called displacement current. But if I just move a little bit on the right in parallel to this capacitance, I have a resistance because ions can flow and this will be a transport current where the current is physically, explicitly moving. It's not just an indirect effect because I'm getting close to the membrane and because of my charisma, I'm attracting somebody from the other side. No.

Yes, there will be some movement but this is not a transport current. A transport current I need to have pores.

So this is another model, and it's some sort of physical wire. Of course, the channel is very tight. It maybe will make only one sodium, one potassium ions at a time, so it will be tough for the ions to pass. It's kind of tight, so friction will be large, or at some molecular scale will be not easy to have two or three sodium ions going simultaneously. But it still matches perfectly the definitions of the **Ohm's law** that says that you have some relationship between a difference of potential and the transport current that is proportional one to the other by a resistance.

So this is just to set ideas for what an equivalent mathematical model would be. So this is what is called an **electrical equivalent model**.

So if I'm a sodium or whatever, potassium, so here it's different, so this is a potassium ion. This is inside, this is the outside. Potassium is highly concentrated inside and very little concentrated outside. In fact, if I *lick*, I *lick* the sodium, not the potassium. I know, this is the fault of that comparison. And *cross* the membrane through this resistance. No, sorry, this is, sorry. Inside the cell and outside the cell, ions can move freely. Maybe they encounter some friction because they have a mobility and this mobility is not infinite. So they do encounter friction due to the viscous property of the medium. And if one ion wants to go from inside to the outside, if there are the conditions to do *so*, it can do it provided there is a bridge.

The conditions would be that you have an electrochemical gradient. You have a lot of potassium inside, so diffusive. In terms of diffusion, you will diffuse. This is the **Fick's law**. The movement, the diffusion will happen from points where there is high concentration to points where it's lower concentration, minus the derivative of the concentration with respect to space. But if you can do that, well, here I need the pore. Otherwise I will hit the insulator, this capacitor.

So the capacitor is there and it's a sort of property per unit of area. So this is clear, it's fine, but they are not only capacitors, they are resistors. Some of them are resistors. And if you allow me to make a first approximation of many, many approximations that I will do and that I did already so far, this resistance is much larger because here it's a very tiny space. So although we call the Stokes law... we only call it $\lambda$, we did not open and say, okay, what is in the geometry of the hole... the *map*... the particle moving... you can probably understand that here moving inside here it's different than moving freely inside and outside. So by comparing this resistance that is placed in parallel to this series of resistance that are... that are placed here inside in series and outside in series, maybe I can approximate that this is like a shortcut. So it's basically negligible. It means that if I have an electrolyte, in solution, the conductivity of the electrolyte is such that, OK, the conductivity is not infinite, but it's as if it's a piece of copper without resistance, with very low resistance, both inside and outside.

So by the way, now you get the **RC circuit**. So the suggestion that I told you that you could measure the properties of the membrane by looking at capacitive transients, now you get it for free. Because you do have resistance and capacitors as I *introduced* the pores.

Okay, there is the membrane potential and this seems to be it. And the question is now, are we done? So basically you have a series of parallel of capacitors and resistors. Maybe you have one resistor per ionic species, but I don't see how you get $-70 \text{ millivolts}$. I can maybe say or see that if you put here charge and you have $-70 \text{ millivolts}$, I know that after a while because of these resistors you will not have any more $-70 \text{ mV}$. You will decay to zero. You will have leak. So this is not clearly enough.

And it's not enough because this is not the perfect model of the pore. It's not the perfect model because yes it's acting as a resistor, but inside here and outside you have two solutions made of different ionic species. It's like Alessandro Volta in his battery. He had two environments with different solutions. And they are joined together. So when they are joined together, there is a battery. There is an effect of an endogenous generation of electric potential.

But this is blah, blah. Let me, probably next week, but let me at least tell you what will be the plan to understand it.

### The Path to the Nernst Potential

So ions are flowing across the permeable membrane, and these two compartments are made of unequal distribution of concentrations. And we only, only, where is it? Yeah, I only simply tell you the strategy and we do it next time.

What we are going to derive is the **Nernst potential**, which is at the **equilibrium**. So now I am really assuming in the next three minutes that we are dead. And the rest we'll see.

So if you have diffusion and you have drift, one thing that you can try to do is you can say in general one molecule or one mole could experience simultaneously drift and diffusion. So what you might have to do is understanding what is the total flux. The total flux is $J_{diffusion} + J_{drift}$.

Let's think that we only have one ionic species. We only have one ionic species. We will not do it. I simply tell you what the plan is. One ionic species. The membrane is permeable to this ionic species. And what else do I need? I need that I consider that it's over. I'm dead. And basically we are at the **thermodynamical equilibrium**.

If we are at the thermodynamical equilibrium, it means that nothing is moving. Nothing is moving. So the **total flux is going to be zero**.

So next week, what I will try to do is to say that everywhere across the membrane, the membrane is... I want to keep the membrane because I want to have two points where I will try to attribute a membrane potential, and the potential is there, so it only awaits to be manipulated, *massaged* in some way. I anticipated we will have to integrate it.

And the assumption that is clearly wrong, although we will see later on that is useful, is follow what Nernst, one of the greatest biochemists and biophysicists *who* existed, what he assumed. He said, okay, in general you have both terms, but it's zero. So zero means not that the drift is compensating for the diffusion, it's that one is the opposite of the other, because it's the *total* flux that is zero.

$J_{total} = J_{drift} + J_{diffusion} = 0$
$\implies J_{drift} = -J_{diffusion}$

This is maybe a little bit, it's not counterintuitive, because for me I see it, the total flux is the superposition of both. If you have an ionic species that is charged and *unequally* distributed, I both drift and diffuse. I cannot do only one. And if I say, look, it's dead, so there is no net flux, that means that this is zero. I cannot assume, it would be wrong to assume that I only do diffusion or I only do drift. No, it's their combination that is zero.

And you can, next week, we are going to, if you want, you may try to do it by yourself. If you assume that one is equal *to* the opposite of the other, you end up with two terms with an equation that is, it is a differential equation, but it's by no means boring and not trivial and not usual. You have this stuff, so this is cancelling out because it's there. So that's why I wanted to keep it like that. Okay, so mobility and concentration are done. Although concentration keeps existing here. But it's interesting that the mobility goes out of the way. So it doesn't matter if it's a big, fat ion or a small, slim ion. Apparently it doesn't for this picture. In the more realistic picture, it does.

And then you have... So this is a number, this is also a number. You have this term and *these* terms that are basically one minus the other. What do you do with this? We'll see you next time. The spoiler is we may try to cancel the derivative, integrating both sides. If you're brave, try, and I'm happy to answer questions.

Okay.
