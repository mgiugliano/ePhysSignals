This is a transcript. I kindly ask you to improve any spelling and grammar mistakes and add punctuation where necessary. Do NOT summarize or change/alter the content in any way. Organize subsequent lines into the same paragraph, whenever needed or appropriate. If you summarise, shrink or otherwise change the text I am going to be very frustrated. Use Markdown, not LaTeX, to decorate the text, create titles/subtitles of sections/subsections.

Please use Markdown to annotate and render bold, italic, mathematical signs, numerical values, etc. whenever appropriate. Do NOT provide the entire response in one go. Subdivide it into chunks. Say into 5 chunks or more. Each chunk should be enclosing sections/subsections so that later on it is easy for me to copy paste all together. Wait for my message to go ahead with the next chunk.
