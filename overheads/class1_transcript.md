### **Part 1: Course Logistics and Introduction**

#### **Section 1: Opening Remarks and Course Language**

Okay. Thank you. Even without a microphone, without this microphone, is it okay?

Since I'm recording, I don't know the effect of this Bluetooth microphone on the amplification device. If, however, at a certain point, my voice is going to decrease for physiological reasons, I'm going to show you and I'm going to put the microphone on.

For vice-versa, I'll give it a couple of minutes because I don't know if all of your colleagues are already here. You are perhaps less than the total number, someone is missing. Do you know if someone is not here?

Anyway.

Hello everyone, I'm Michele Giugliano. The G is redundant. You will learn this because I'm obsessed with the fact that people write it correctly. Also because on Google, otherwise, there are 25,000 results if you want to have contact or search for me.

The intention would be to do the course in English. I'm not Shakespeare, you'll hear it. It's an opportunity, if most of you agree, to offer something more. Most of the courses in bioengineering and in general, in master's degrees, in *laureate*, in Italy, are in English. You can acquire passive English. I don't ask... if you have questions or comments, you can do it in English. You can do it in English. For an exam, idem. I will give you more details in a few minutes. You can do it in English. In English, all the world is in English. You can be exposed for free, not to a native speaker, *non a un madrelingua*, but to someone who learned it and chewed it up on the road, *a qualcuno che l'ha imparato e l'ha masticato sulla strada*, and you simply get more practice. You have the recordings of the lectures, maybe I will even provide the audio myself, I can provide you with the transcript, so the speech-to-text. And then you can, if at a certain point my pronunciation changes from London Cockney to Edinburgh, becomes Scottish, maybe you can give me a sign and tell me you didn't understand. We have to be together every week from now until mid-December, it will be tough, with this slog of four hours of non-stop lectures. So you can absolutely interrupt me and say, "I didn't understand, can you explain it again?"

If you agree, I'll switch to English. A technical English is not so different. Not only does the world revolve and function in English—the scientific literature is in English, the textbooks are in English—you have a quantity today in your pocket, you have all the knowledge, the PDFs of any article, you don't have to go to a library to make photocopies, and it's all in English. You have a huge amount of tutorials, of videos on YouTube, besides videos of kittens and other various nonsense, but it's all in English. Bombard yourselves, if you can, with English. It's an extra professional skill. You can have it, or not, and you could be better than your colleagues who don't have it. And it's not rocket science.

Okay, I switched to English.

So welcome. I am the coordinator of this course and I'm teaching you this module, which is called "Electrophysiological Signals." In general, please come to me if you have problems with any other module, particularly at the end when you have to take all the exams for each module. If you have any problems or if you have any advice or criticism on how we can improve the entire course, please speak up.

#### **Section 2: Attendance, Communication, and Course Materials**

So I'm going to track attendance. Please download, if you don't have it already, the app. I don't do it for controlling you; I do it for my own sake to understand whether it's true, like in the past few years, that after the first couple of classes people got scared and they stopped. No, I'm joking, they did not stop attending, but I would love to see whether also in terms of timing, in terms of schedule, this is doable for you. So at every class, I will give a different code. Today it is **9PSTK**. You put it in the app and basically, it's tracking your attendance. And I think if you send it to a colleague of yours who is not here, it will not work. Please. No problem, I don't care. It's just roughly for statistics. The same thing happened last year, so for attendance tracking, I don't care. For me, it's just roughly the case.

What I do care about, but not for controlling you, just to offer you a communication channel, is Teams. So if some of you are not yet registered, let me know. If you can join in a moment... I'll give you... I'll change the slide in 30 seconds. There is a QR code for you to join the Teams, and in principle, via Teams, we can chat. You all should constitute some sort of mini-community. You should help each other if you have questions about the content of the class and in general the content of the course. You're more than welcome to post your questions and try to help each other, but in general, you can reach me via instant messaging. So... And those who are not yet registered officially might have troubles. So if you do not have a unimore.it email address, please contact me, send me an email with your, say, Gmail account, and I will add you manually in the meantime.

So this is the QR code to join Teams. I think most of you, if not all, were on Teams. And you can do it in two ways. One is by the QR code; it should bring you directly to the Teams of the course, of this module. Well, sorry, no, it's of the entire course, but it's probably only me using it. And then otherwise, if you have already Teams installed, you can join the room, join the chat, the group, the team with that code. All of this, you have on the overhead, which I will post up front before the start of each class. It could be the day before, it could be maybe two days before, it might be five minutes before. So you will have the slides, so don't worry. You don't necessarily have to write down everything, because you are going to have the slides. And the slides are not posted on Teams, although I might say, "Hey, I posted..." We have a website for this module, which is... I'm coming to that in a moment. So if you're not a Unimore student yet, send me an email—remember the extra G, otherwise you don't find me on the internet—and you send me your, say, Gmail account, whatever, your email, because that is needed for me to add you to Teams. Please.

You Google it. You're digital natives, you should be able to search "Michele Giuliano Unimore"—it should be me. Give it a try if you don't. The only thing you have to remember that unfortunately is I am redundant. There is an extra G. So I will show you in a moment.

We have a course website, and we have a GitHub repository. Does any of you know what GitHub is and what a repository on GitHub is? It's a website where people can store files. So if I want to give you something, I put the PDF of my presentations there. Or if I want to share code, I can do it and I do it there. And everybody will, if the repository is free, be able to download the files. In the technical environment, in the technical professional sector, sometimes not only geeks but also people involved in software development, but also nowadays hardware, also in open source, also in open science, it is becoming permanent to have a GitHub account. It's your portfolio. So you're encouraged to create your own GitHub account profile. And if, whatever, if some of the courses at this university are suggesting you or requiring you to do a mini-project, for instance, you can put the code or the electronic schematics or the chemical solution, whatever, as well as your report, if you want to publish it to the world, on the GitHub repository. You can put your GitHub repository, your GitHub username account on your CV. Nowadays people are curious; not only do they find the email of almost anyone, but they can kind of see, "Okay, who is this guy or this lady? What did he or she do?" So having a web presence might be professionally something cool.

I don't remember whether this QR code is pointing to that website, which is posted on GitHub pages, or on this. So github.com is the site where you might want to be curious. It's owned by Microsoft. It has been acquired recently, and it's free for students. With your student email, you can get some sort of free account that allows you to have unlimited public or private repositories. So you can even have your private stuff there. And the website looks like this, so it's a boring website where you have several tabs. One is with just a few lines on aims, what you hope to get from this module. There is a schedule; it's almost every, every, every week on Tuesday. We still don't know the room, the logistics for the other days. I will post it as soon as I have this information. What else is on this website? There is the exact content of all the topics at the end of the semester. You may want to check on this list because this list is what I will have in front of me while asking you questions. But more on the exam later. Now I scared you with this, you say, "Oh my god, you will ask me about the definition of mobility of an ion in solution." I could, but it's a trivial thing, it's a conventional thing, as we will see possibly next week.

Not only the content, and by the way, there is some sort of chapter 0, which I'm not covering. It's about mathematics: differential equations, calculus, basically. So, derivatives, integrals. It's very brief, it's a series of brief videos amounting to, I don't remember whether it's two or three hours. Use this material, it's a refresher if you need it. I'm not a mathematician, I'm an engineer, but sometimes we will use the language of mathematics. I don't know whether you're fond of or familiar with Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize winner, a very famous physicist. He basically said, "Sorry, but nature speaks the language of mathematics." If you want to understand how nature speaks, and since we are talking about biological systems, well, you have to, and it's a natural system, you need to use the language of math. Possibly your background, I will ask you in maybe 10 minutes to tell me in 30 seconds who you are. Maybe your background is all in engineering; you should not be particularly scared about mathematics. There, anyway, you have material to support you. And at any point, even if it's something really stupid, like "Sorry, I don't remember algebra," come to me and ask questions. I prefer, maybe during class or in the breaks, or later during office hours, that you come to me and maybe I can help you by giving an explanation. And you can maybe catch up and finally remember algebra, instead of carrying over the problem for several weeks or months and having issues with maybe otherwise mathematical parts of the course.

Not only the content, you also have resources. So here it's something where I will put some stuff: PDFs, links to videos, links to papers from the literature. I cannot post PDFs of books, of course, as you know, and I invite you never to look at pirate websites because on these websites, being illegal, you can find almost any book. And if you want to quickly have a look at some book, you should not go on these illegal websites. So this is also a place where I posted some links to tutorials, say about programming in Python, or maybe you are or are not familiar with using computers with a keyboard, with the so-called command-line interface, instead of with a mouse and a graphical user interface. We will not use it, but if you want, there are some links here. And there are also some videos that I will show you today about examples of electrophysiological signals. But the most interesting part are these two links. If you click on either of them, you are brought to the GitHub website where you see it's a sort of file system. Here you have files, here you have notebooks (and I will tell you what notebooks are), and here you have the overheads. And this is the slide that I posted yesterday and then updated a couple of hours ago to add some stuff. Okay, so this is very convenient. You do not need necessarily to reach GitHub; you can reach the website. What else is there? I think that's it. So here, Teams, I'll disable it. Before it was thought to be on Discord, but I will disable this. There is no Discord group anymore.

The Spirit, and here you might see some rambling on why online, regardless of the fact that I'm there also in the same team, but you should be a decent person, you should not harass your colleagues, and my hope is that maybe, depending on how shy or extroverted you are, maybe you can help each other. Maybe someone has a question about, "Well, I did not understand what the guy meant with this mobility of ions in a solution, did you understand it?" "Yes, look, I explained it to myself..."—I'm just thinking of a colleague of yours who might answer—"I explained it to myself as a person, as a body swimming in the sea and finding friction." If you don't talk in real life, maybe try to talk in your digital life. But try to talk, and particularly talk to me if possible. So this is the website. And the website is also reachable from Teams, which has a crappy interface, but at the top, there is a tab that I added where if you go on that tab, you go to the website. And the mathematical preliminaries and the handouts, so the slides, as well as the notebooks, are posted there.

#### **Section 3: Practical Work and Prerequisites**

Notebooks are, for those of you who know what this is, but I invite you to have a look at a YouTube video in a moment, it's a sort of practice involving Python. But this is not a class on scientific computing, so I don't necessarily want you to become proficient in Python. I will show you something and we'll do it with Google Colab, so you don't have to install anything on your computer and you use Google's free cloud computing time. If you want to install something on your laptop and you have troubles because you're not a computer scientist—neither am I—but you can come to me and say, "Look, I have troubles, I can't manage." I'm not an IT guy but I'm happy to help. In other universities, in the room, there would be like two or three people, sort of teaching assistants, who will be there to say, "Let me, I will do it for you, I will help you." We don't have that, it's just me. And don't be shy, you can hopefully count on me.

So this is about the mathematical refresher. I suppose, I assume you don't need it, but it covers very basic things like what a mathematical function is, what a plot is, what does it mean if you take a mathematical function and you add something or subtract a quantity—maybe the graph is going to shift vertically, horizontally, etc. And some notable functions like straight lines, exponentials, logarithms, blah blah. Derivatives, they will be very useful, and integrals will also be very useful, both definite and indefinite. As I said, I'm not a mathematician; this is not a course in mathematics. There was something on the blackboard from a previous class that was geometry. Although we are in the Institute of Pure Mathematics, I'm not in love with mathematics to that extent. And then there are other things you might not have seen. Well, you should, being engineers. Those of you who are engineers should be familiar with the Dirac delta function, typically used in linear systems to probe the response to a pulse, and the convolution integral. Again, it's something that you might have heard about, maybe people call it filtering, but it's the same thing. And again, differential equations—only one differential equation, what I will call over and over the only, boring, typical, usual differential equation that I would love you to get acquainted with, and it's this one. Say this is a function of time; it's this one, maybe plus something. This first-order differential equation, the coefficients are constant, and I don't ask you whether you remember what the solution is. I only invite you to refresh your knowledge, not mnemonically, but just by understanding it and reading aloud what it is. It says: what is the function *f*—since differential equations are equations where the unknown is not a number like in an algebraic equation, but it's a function, so it's a collection of... well, it's a rule, it's a mapping, it's not only a collection of numbers—what is this function that when you take its derivative you get the function itself? There are also some memes on the internet where there is a function that no matter if you differentiate it, it just stays the same. Only geeks... do you remember which function this is? It's the only function that is worth... yeah, I like the exponential. Exponential, yeah, indeed. I thought you said logarithm, `ln(x)`. No, it's the exponential, perfect. So you don't need it, but we'll see even during some parts of the course where I'm going to derive some mathematical formulas, I'm not going to assume that you are very skilled or at ease with mathematics, hopefully.

So there is no guarantee... I thought that maybe that stuff over there was a camera, but it's not a camera, so I brought my own cameras and I'm trying to record with my own microphones. Hopefully, it will work. Sometimes there might be some glitches, so there is no guarantee, but after... so I'm not streaming, I'm recording, and at the end... let me check that I'm recording because otherwise... yeah, I am... otherwise, it will be disastrous. And maybe the day after, a couple of days later, depending on when I can upload the file to YouTube, you will find it on this channel. There will be a playlist with the name of the course. But again, I hope so. Last year, nothing happened. You never know, the computer, the battery, everything can go wrong. Sometimes I might forget to... well, in this case, it will not happen because I changed the setup, but say I might... you will only see my face and not the slides. You do have the slides, so it's not the end of the world. And maybe you don't see my face, and okay, fine, you can survive not seeing my face.

#### **Section 4: Class Structure, Exams, and My Teaching Philosophy**

Okay, practicalities. Classes are in person, slides, and chalk. I hope they are interactive, really, I mean it. I don't give a damn if you ask a stupid question. I don't care. I forget. I really don't care. I will not remember at the exam, saying, "This person..." No, I honestly don't care. I have other things on my mind and I cannot read yours... I cannot read your mind. So I have some experience from many years of teaching, so I can see whether you are completely blanking and you're brain-dead. Right now, maybe a little bit scared, but not yet. So if you don't speak, I cannot help. I cannot try again, being clearer, explaining myself in a different way. So I ask you to be interactive. And of course, it will be boring if I have to talk for four hours straight, although there will be breaks, don't worry. And I will propose there are some alternatives for breaks depending on what you... what you do. So I don't mind stupid questions. And again, if you need help, maybe you're shy to ask in front of your colleagues. It's normal, everybody, to some degree, is shy. You can contact me. And even if you have some problems with whatever... okay, not your personal problems hopefully, but if you have interests or if you are passionate about something or if you realize that you don't know about something else, ask. I'm happy to help. In principle, that's my main job: to transfer knowledge. And so if you want information about some topic or even in general about bioengineering or about neuroscience or about neuroengineering, come to me.

So handouts, I told you, they are made available to you upfront. Videotaping, hopefully. For all of you in the class, if the slides were the only things required to pass the exams, then I would basically be better off staying at home, and you probably as well. So I'm going to add more stuff, and you can stop me. And I'm not, say, super intelligent or super knowledgeable, but I know a little bit and I can tell it to you, and particularly by reacting to your questions, there might be way more stuff than what's on the slides.

So the hands-on, there will be some practical parts just to make your life a little bit more interesting, hopefully. It doesn't need to be... I mean, you can listen to this stuff completely passively. Again, you don't need to install anything on your computer. I would maybe suggest those of you who are really interested to do that, and it's about installing, for instance, Python and some distribution of Jupyter. I don't know whether you know what this is, but otherwise, if you don't and you only want to use a web browser because you only have, say, a tablet and you don't want to bother, you can use a website which is hosted by Google and it's free to some extent. It's called Colab. And of course here I don't have any notebook to show you. It's some sort of web interface where you can use their computers to crunch numbers, to plot functions, to plot data. And you also can mix text, code, which is not around, which I don't see the code here. Okay, here it's code, whatever it is. I'm not particularly familiar or fond of Python, but okay, so this is Python code and this is a plot. So on the same document you have text, explanations, annotations, code, and the result of this code. This is becoming a common practice in general in science where people are not only giving you the data—so a few years ago they were not even giving you the data. "Here is the paper, study the paper, trust the authors for the results." No, today, hoping to have reproducible science and research, we give you not only the data that we acquired, say in an experiment—say plugging myself into some electrodes in a moment, although it will not work—and then not only give you the data, I give you the code that I use to analyze the data and I put it on the same page, really for dummies. For dummies in the sense that it doesn't require people to install stuff on their machines and hopefully it will possibly be reproducible. A few years ago, there was this image of the black hole that was reconstructed by means of algorithmic means. Probably you all remember this sort of donut, it's a sort of *ciambella*, it's red with a hole in it. And that was the first image of a black hole. They gave the data and they gave what they call notebooks, so this thing, to people together with their publications. This is what the hands-on parts are, and these notebooks are already posted, all of them. If you want to be curious and you want to sneak a peek, they are on the GitHub repository in the folder called "notebooks." And again, for prerequisites about math, coding, and particularly biology, which I suspect you might not be ultra-strong in, ask. There is some material for the next, not necessarily for the next week but in general for the next couple of weeks, that I posted. It is on the GitHub repository and you'll also find the links. It's some reading material that you may or may not read. It's not something that I will ask at the exam, but it's something that you will need if you feel weak in terms of biology, neurobiology in particular. So on these slides, I gave you the link to that YouTube video from a guy, a blond guy if I remember, that in like two or three minutes explains what Google Colab is, what notebooks are. And this was the solution that I... so the alternative... so if you are in between, if you're not completely scared by computers and so you use that, and if you're not a computer geek that you install your own distribution of Python using Anaconda or virtual environments with UV or pip or whatever, then this is intermediate. And it was a standalone application that you could download on your computer to have, on your computer, your machine, the same thing that's over there in the cloud. It was called JupyterLab Desktop, and a few months ago they stopped developing it. So it still works, but I don't know for how long. You may give it a try. When you download it, it downloads Python inside itself. And so you have Python on your computer encapsulated, wrapped inside this software. This is because installing Python may not be entirely trivial, particularly if you have, say, a Mac or if you're on Windows where there are also another series of complications. If you are using Linux then you probably are sleeping now because you're supposed to be more expert about installing stuff.

So the exam for this module is an oral interview, informal. I don't like quizzes, I don't like written tests, because I'm not there to help you. If you go blank because you're getting emotional, you don't remember things, I'm not there to see, "Okay, okay, good, I want to help." And maybe you need just a bit of information just to restart. It happens all the time, it happened to me as well. I hated particularly the closed-answer questionnaires. This is humiliating to me. You have to be given time, 20 minutes, half an hour, that I'm sitting there and I listen to you while you recreate on a blackboard in detail what I do or present to you during the class. And the overall... I will show you the statistics in a moment, although it's based only on last year, but it's still something that you might be interested to know. So the final score is the score of individual modules, and it's weighted by the credits, by the CFU. So depending on how many credits, the score, the mark that you get in one module, has a bigger weight. *Cum laude* means that you have to get 32 out of 30 in total, although in my module I gave several *cum laude* last year. And we round to the closest integer. So we don't look at the ceiling, the integer that is approximating by excess or by defect by floor. We just use the closest integer. And it requires, you cannot skip any module, and you're supposed to complete the entire thing in 24 months, in two years, which is reasonable. So for the moment, since it's basically the start of the second year, we don't know, there are only two or three people out of 20, if I remember correctly, who did not complete all the modules. They are missing mine or another one, I don't recall.

So statistics from the past. So that's the average mark. So I think that you can lower your anxiety, particularly because I was told that you are quite smart. I don't know, other lecturers had a good impression and I'm curious to interact with you, just to learn from you. So you see I'm not particularly strict and all the people were good. And one out of three got *cum laude* because they were interested, not because I gave it as a gift to them. And overall, across all the modules of this entire big course, you see the final mark was not particularly low. And so this might lower your anxiety.

Exams and exam sessions. I think I will have six sessions of exams in January-February. I did not manage to add them yet on the ugly online platform called ESSE3, which is very crappy, but that's the only thing. And I will ask you to register with great advance, maybe during the month of December you decide when you want to take your exam, my part, just my part. And you see there are 12 slots a day and there are... 14 from 8:00 in the morning until 1:00 p.m., one after the other. It takes the time that it takes. Unless you're really abusing the time, I will stop you. So if we go 40 minutes instead of... so I will try to be fair, so that all people get 20-25 minutes. So I will try to be fair in that respect. I cannot add sessions in June or July yet, but you will see it's plenty of opportunities. And exceptionally, you can contact me and we can schedule one appointment on a day that you want if this is fulfilling some sort of need. I would love to avoid having this as a rule because otherwise, you will say, "Okay, maybe today, maybe tomorrow, what do you do tomorrow? Can I do the exam?" and maybe you don't show up. If you register, if you contact me, then you must show up. I will not fail you if you don't show up, but as I'm going to help you, you help me not blocking time.

Now for the... I know that you finish the previous class at 1 p.m., so you have only one hour for lunch. My preference is to start at 2 p.m. sharp and finish a little bit earlier—well, 50 minutes earlier, but better than nothing. But it's your call. The alternative would be that we can even start at the famous academic quarter of an hour or even at 2:30. Of course, we would then exceed because I need the amount of hours. And the idea is you can think of it, you don't have to... we don't have to decide. Well, today we started around 2:05, and you tell me what's your preference. Maybe make a poll, make a Doodle, do whatever, and let me know.

Breaks. Normally I do, because I'm used to it... I taught for 11 years in Belgium to students of several curricula, but they were not bioengineers like you are. And they were a bit intimidated and they were going blank after a while. So the style was that I was stopping, like I'm planning to do today, every 45-50 minutes for a 10-minute break. A 10-15 minute break. We will do three of these breaks. Maybe you have a stronger stamina, I don't know. There are alternatives. We could only stop after one hour. Probably I cannot do four hours in a row, but a couple of hours I can do. I can do it, particularly if I get... you will see some topics will get me excited and I hope that I can at least pass this enthusiasm to you, or at least that you learn, "Okay, this topic is cool but I don't care and I don't want to do this in life." Fine. For me, it would be a success to tell you what you might or might not be good at, or might not be passionate about. So that's another possibility, that we only do one break. For the moment we have another 10 minutes to go and then if you want, we'll break. Otherwise, you let me know. When the timer rings you will tell me whether you want me to continue for another, say, 45 minutes or you want to stop.

### **Part 2: Instructor and Student Introductions**

#### **Section 1: About Me, Your Instructor**

So I'll tell you a little bit about myself. I'm an electronic engineer by training. At the time I studied in Genoa, I started in 1992, which seems like a really long time ago, and there was no bioengineering, there was no biomedical engineering, but there was already some sort of specialization that was biomedical engineering, and this was what I took. I'm very proud that I did not take some classic exams as engineers do, like economics and construction science, because I didn't care, and I wanted to study biology. I wanted to study some topics that I chose. At that moment it was bioelectromagnetism, and there was another one that was bioelectronics. I wanted to do that. That seemed to be the future. And indeed, that's the case. But it's me. That was me. Then I continued with a PhD, a doctorate in Genoa, well in reality it was in Milan, but it was under the supervision of a pioneer of bioengineering and neuroengineering in Italy, the late Massimo Grattarola. And I basically did a PhD in bioengineering and it was basically about computational neuroscience, which is a discipline related to using models and computers to study the brain. And then I left Italy. That was a very good decision. And I regret that I'm back, but that's another story.

So I did my first postdoc, which in the academic trajectory is what you do, you continue doing research. And I did it in an institute of physiology at the Faculty of Medicine in Switzerland, in Bern, at the University of Bern. To joke, I say that I was looking for the best chocolate. In Genoa, although it's not Liguria, there is this Novi Ligure chocolate, which is still my favorite, but I wanted to try other things. So Switzerland was a clear step to take, so I did that. And then after a few years, I moved to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, the EPFL in Lausanne, which is a terrific place. I was a group leader and both during my postdoc and my second postdoc I was doing experiments myself, doing electrophysiological experiments. So that's why I'm here to tell you about electrophysiological signals. And I'm particularly interested in cells, not the entire thing. So I will try to show you something, but it will not work, of course, but I'm more intrigued by the mechanism, in the same way that transistors in this device are sort of microscopic units that determine the computational features, the properties of the device. Then I moved to Belgium, so the other step for chocolate is Liguria, which is Novi Ligure, it's not in Liguria, but anyway, so Switzerland, then Belgium, although Belgian chocolate, I don't know whether you know it, it's a bit complex. It's not plain good or bad, it's with stuff inside. It was not my thing, but I stayed there 11 years, 10-11 years, and I was a professor of neuroscience. And then I came in 2019, just in time for the pandemic and for the lockdown, as a professor of physiology at SISSA, that is like Scuola Superiore di Pisa. It's special, it's only a PhD, research-intensive institution. And in 2024, I joined Modena because they wanted to, and they did, start bioengineering, and as you know, there was no bioengineering before. So I basically... this is my trajectory.

And as I said, I'm intrigued by the mechanisms, particularly of cells and nerve cells that we will have ample time to talk about and to discuss. They are electrical devices, and to me, it blew my mind as a student, more or less... maybe I was one year younger than what you are now, to learn from a professor that not only were they electrical devices, they were sort of generating signals very fast. This is one millisecond, and on the y-axis... it's a picture from an oscilloscope in the old times. You were not able to record the data with an analog-to-digital converter like this one that is now very small and conveniently attached to a USB cable. At that time you were taking a picture on either a paper recorder or an oscilloscope. So very brief, one millisecond, and about 100 millivolts. That's the amplitude of a nerve impulse. And 100 millivolts is 0.1 volts, and it's not so different from what the internal voltages of a microprocessor are. Maybe you're familiar with your power plug which is 5 volts, or you maybe know if you play with electronics that some stuff is powered by 3.6, 3.3 volts, whatever. Modern microprocessors have internal voltages that are even smaller. And there you eat a banana or chocolate and you fire that. You don't need a small nuclear plant like ChatGPT does. So this blew my mind, and the other thing that blew my mind was that it was possible to write equations. And it was, for me, amazing. How could you study biology with mathematics and physics and chemistry? Well, after all, it is physics, chemistry, and mathematics, so it may not be surprising, but to write an equation that maybe can describe the electrical activity of neurons, maybe one neuron or a network of neurons, really inspired me a lot. And so that's why I basically got into this field, with the dream of understanding how the brain works—of course, this is still a dream—and to make some sort of difference or to sort of bring some positive things in, say for patients, for patients with neurological disorders.

And again, I'm intrigued by cells. These cells that you see here have been filled with a dye. They are from the cortex of a human, but no students were sacrificed at that stage. It was from a patient, and they are called pyramidal cells. They are called pyramidal cells because their soma resembles a pyramid, and you see a lot of cables. Nerve cells are cables; they have a lot of wires, and this is impressive. And when you look at this, you will not see exactly this image under a microscope with living tissue. It's remarkable how dense this network is. And if you open an electronic device, maybe you should try at some point to break something and open it, because nowadays the printed circuit boards are very complicated. You will see that there are a lot of cables, a lot of leads, a lot of contacts. And one of the famous, well, the most famous neuroanatomist that studied these cells was at the end of the last century, or sorry, at the beginning of the last century, around 1901, 1905. He was from Spain. His name was Ramón y Cajal, and he looked at this and he understood and he got it right, that these things are kind of fetching inputs from there, and something that you don't see here, there is another fiber that is bringing signals out, and that's the output. And the guy, just by looking at these images, understood the function, well, understood some features of the function, which is remarkable. But the reason why I thought of telling you about this is because he called them the "butterflies of the mind," of the brain. And indeed, they are beautiful, as opposed, say, to sperm cells that are the example of minimalism. They have nothing, it's just a cell body and a tail to swim. These guys are baroque, they are so complicated and they reminded him of trees. So particularly all of this branching and bifurcations, like trees. Unfortunately, we don't have windows to look outside; there are trees. Next, as you go out, have a look at trees. In that case, trees are bifurcating, are branching, probably to fetch light, to expand the surface to fetch light. Over there, maybe these cells are expanding to fetch inputs. And over there, it's the top where my hair is, so it's called layer one, or the pia mater, which is one of the dura and pia mater. It would be what is immediately below the bone, below the scalp. And what you have here is the white matter, which is kind of in my ventral part. And so somehow this guy is having this sort of fiber which is called a dendrite, from the Greek word for tree, *albero*, *dendros*, and then it's kind of towards the top, it's bifurcating, it's branching to fetch inputs.

What do we want to do? We stop or we continue? For me, it's the same. Just don't be shy, I'm fine whatever you say. Who wants to stop? So let's stop. So we come back in 10 minutes. Thank you.

#### **Section 2: My Research and Student Introductions**

So, I lead a laboratory, an experimental laboratory, that you're welcome to visit if you're interested, upon appointment in the coming months or even next year, whenever you want. And we do three things, we combine three disciplines. One is experimental neurophysiology. So we want to study *logos*, the physiology, the functioning of nerve cells, or the electrical function of nerve cells, and we do it experimentally. And then we also use mathematical models and physics and computers to make sense of the data that we record, as well as to make new experiments that involve a computer. We do hybrid circuits where some part is a biological neuron, some biological cells, and some part is simulated cells. And I also work at the interface with neurotechnologies, so nanomaterials or non-conventional tools such as optogenetics. Did any of you hear about optogenetics? I will tell you what it is. In a few years, I'm pretty sure they will give a Nobel Prize to these two people, two American scientists. They invented a way to make a protein that normally real neurons do not express—well, they express it in the retina in some cells of the retina—and you shine light with a laser beam... I do have it, this... well, it's not really a laser beam... hello, yeah... so you shine light with a laser beam literally and non-invasively you are able to excite or inhibit the electrical activity of a cell. Imagine that you are suffering from seizures, we will probably discuss it later today, and you have a seizure that means a very sudden, highly synchronized electrical activity in your brain. In principle, I could shine light with a fiber optic and I could switch it off. It's not yet reality but they will get the Nobel Prize. So today we don't use it for therapeutic reasons, we don't put it in the faulty retina of blind patients to restore... well, somebody does and they were successful in restoring vision, but we use it as a way to probe cells and circuits and networks because we can interrogate by stimulating or inhibiting just in a non-invasive way. Imagine literally I can have a laser beam and I can move it to different positions, so I can excite this neuron here and I can maybe inhibit this neuron there, but I will tell you in due time, I will tell you more.

Now you tell me... okay, first, before asking you to tell me about yourself in 30 seconds, in my free time, when I have free time, I'm a geek and I'm particularly intrigued by radio transmissions. And I... it's now a few years that I'm trying to learn... it's a stupid thing because you never heard of it, but it's all pedagogically thought out, so you will see that it makes sense. One of the reasons is that I'm fascinated because the way neurons encode information is clearly not by a man-made code, but they do it in a way that seems to depend on the frequency of this nerve impulse. Now I have no idea whether in the cars, say of your parents or your own car, you still have something that is called a radio. When I was younger and even today I have a radio and the radio had two bands, so it's not only podcasts and not only Bluetooth connection to a device, but you could literally hear radio transmissions from a radio DJ or whatever. And it's FM instead of AM. Have you ever heard of this? So AM, maybe those engineers among you who studied electrical communication, they might even have studied the nitty-gritty of it. So with amplitude modulation, the carrier, which I won't tell you what it is, is modulated by the information content by changing its amplitude. Now for a nerve impulse, it seems this is not the case. All the nerve impulses have this 100 millivolt, 0.1 volt amplitude, but what changes is the frequency, like in FM. And in fact, you know that AM is sort of noisy, sloppy. I don't know whether you ever... if you have a radio, try to put it on AM and you will hear a lot of noise. Instead FM, when you are on the right frequency, the quality of the sound is very nice. So encoding information in frequency is more robust in terms of signal-to-noise ratio. And maybe this is not a surprise that my foot is controlled by some neurons in my motor cortex by frequency modulation. And instead in my retina, where the distances are very, very tiny, very small, neurons also communicate by amplitude modulation. It's not really the nerve impulses and other things, but this is very interesting. That's why I'm a geek, because I take things from work home and vice versa. Maybe it can be of interest.

Each of you, I would love to hear for 10 seconds who you are, what is your background. Some of you already told me that they are not engineers and I'm fine, actually I'm very happy that there is diversity. I hope that the engineers among you will help those who are biologists or physiologists and vice versa, the physiologists could help the engineers who might be ignorant in other things. And why bioengineering? That would be very interesting. And if you don't know why, that's fine. I did not know for a while what to do in life, for many years, even during university, and so that's fine. And if you want, what do you do in your free time, if you do sports or whatever. So please, let's start like this, otherwise you will... you will have a start. I don't care, even if you can do it in Italian, in English, whatever, feel free.

Thank you. I can't. Thank you. Chocolate? No, just kidding, just kidding. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Thanks everyone, I really appreciate it, you're a tough crowd. So I hope to work well with you and that you can find interesting ideas in what I tell you.

### **Part 3: Study Materials and Course Structure**

#### **Section 1: Recommended Reading**

Okay, so as study material, there is one book that covers most of the topics. Of course, it does it in a very structured way, not necessarily in the way that I will follow, but it's the first one. And I think I ordered... well I think, I'm pretty sure I ordered at least two copies last year and they are available in the libraries. Do not attempt to find it on PDF on illegal websites, but sometimes some of the books are good to have, and so that one is a nice book. It is authored by a series of researchers, particularly one from Norway. And of course, I forgot the name of... Okay, it will come to me. So he's a pioneer, the last author of that book. Gaute Einevoll is a pioneer on some of the techniques that we will also discuss later on, the extracellular signals in the brain.

There are other books that you can look at. So these are classic books for... and again, I wrote chapters, so it doesn't... I don't mean from chapter 1 to chapter 20, and some of the books are really, really... it's a sort of Bible. So this is the Bible of cell biology. It's really a tiny big book and it has a lot of details. Same as Kandel, Schwartz, and it has now other authors, possibly it's not 2012, but it's *Principles of Neuroscience*. It's again a Bible and it's only for references. This is a light introduction to neuroscience and the first four chapters might be useful for those of you who are not necessarily that familiar with the biological aspects. And *From Neuron to Brain* by Nicholls et al., 1996, is about... it's a two-volume book and it's about biophysics. Again, not the entire book would be required, but you will find the content of the classes over there.

There are a few things, a few readings that are available on GitHub as well as linked on the website as PDFs. So one is just a few pages... for those of you, probably you don't use it anymore and it's not a thing anymore. When I was a student in high school, there was a company called Bignami and they were making very tiny booklets for Latin or history or philosophy, whatever. So this is a sort of Bignami. So it's very condensed and it's an immensely incomplete summary, but in two pages, it tells you what a neuron is, what a synapse is, what a receptor is. You might want to just have it, to use it, and I think it's just maybe two or four pages, if I remember correctly. This is more blah blah, it's not even aimed at students, it's for the general public on brain facts, and it's an introduction on the... a little bit on the working of the brain, particularly the early parts that are not dealing with behavior. Of course, you can read it, you can read all of it, but for the topics of the course, only the first couple of chapters are relevant. And then there is also the entire PDF, because it was put in the public domain by one of the Nobel Prize winners of several years ago, I think it was in the 60s, Hubel. Have you ever heard of Hubel and Wiesel? I will show you later what they did. So this guy wrote a very tiny book, very high level, very, say, science communication, so it's not a technical book, called *Eye, Brain, and Vision*, and it tells about the part of the brain that we understand the most. And for me, as a student, it was a very nice primer, a very nice introduction to the neurobiological concepts that came up over and over again. So you might find it relevant. You don't have to study it. I'm not going to ask about material from these things. They are readings for you. You should be selfish. You should study for yourself, not for the exam. And as you could see, the exam at the end is not going to be impossible to pass. You should now try to study for your own professional life, not as a strategy to pass the exam. There is no point if you study just to pass the exam; in a matter of a couple of weeks after, you will forget everything. If not, if you study for yourself, maybe you will learn and remember things for your lifetime.

#### **Section 2: Practical Data and Demonstrations**

So, what I will also do, because the demo that I would like to attempt now in the next 10 minutes will not work for a series of reasons. The last one is that I had the bad idea to rehearse it last night. And as those who have experience with electronics, they know the term "magic smoke." "Magic smoke" is what happens at some point when something burns and you see smoke coming up out of electronic circuits. And so I don't think it will work. And there are other reasons that I will tell you why it will not work. But you have data on the GitHub pages, as well as you have a notebook that I will invite you to play with. "Play" means you load it into Python, you plot it, and maybe then it's up to you. You can do the Fast Fourier Transform to get rhythms in these traces, although they are crappy traces. It's something that I recorded last year. And another thing that you could say, being an electrocardiogram, there are peaks. It was my electrocardiogram from last year. Maybe you could find a way to count how many peaks there are, but we will see that later. So, you even have a YouTube tutorial that will sort of illustrate this notebook. This is not compulsory. I encourage you to do it. Again, if you don't do it, I don't care, but it has been done just to pique your curiosity. But let me skip this for the moment. Where is the demo? I want to do the demo now. But okay, first I have to talk about frogs, otherwise I cannot say whether I am like a frog or not. Okay, so maybe we do, say in 10-15 minutes we'll break, and then we'll do the demo later on.

The demo has a little bit of a component of risk, that's why I'm not asking any volunteer to be plugged in, because in principle, and maybe I will ask for your help in the future, everything could be working with a battery, because I could disconnect the power supply of the computer, and the computer now is standalone. But the computer, unfortunately, because of the video projector, is attached to this HDMI cable, and that one is a source of potential risk, because the ground of this cable, the reference electrode of this cable could be floating, so I could electrocute myself. I hope it doesn't happen, but I don't want to electrocute you. It would be one bioengineer less, so it could be less competition, but it will not be fair to do this at the university. And this may not electrocute me, but it will create a lot of noise. You will see how bad noise is. So, I'll talk about signals that I'm going to show you, maybe, or maybe not. And I'll talk about noise.

I ask you, what is a signal? What is a biological signal? You have the slide, so you can read what the slide says. Do you have any suggestions? Some of you have been already exposed to signals. I don't remember who, but you told me that you did data and signals. So you should be familiar with this definition, a rigorous definition of signals that maybe you will see again, you have seen it in the last couple of days, from my colleagues. But I would love to set the topic on what is a signal. What do you think is a signal? What could that be? Thank you. Perfect. And this series of data points, maybe they could be in time, assuming that my heart beats, and at some point now and half a second later, and half a second later, I might record a different kind of distribution of electrical potential. Or it might be a set of numbers that are changing in space like an image, like an fMRI—well, fMRI would be in time as well—let's say like an MRI scan. There will be an image, it's a collection of... it's a bi-dimensional collection of numbers. In every coordinate (x,y) you will have one number, for instance, like this image. So that's correct, thank you. So it's a physical variable, it's an observable perhaps related to a biological system that is subject to some sort of variation. Otherwise, it would be boring, it would be just a value, it would be 26. 26 what? 26 millivolts maybe, or let's say minus 70 millivolts that will come over and over. It will be boring if it's always minus 70 millivolts. If it changes over time, that might be interesting. Maybe you're alive or maybe you're dead. At least I can tell whether you're dead or alive. So variations in time or in space. And it can be represented analytically by some formula, a mathematical function, but it does not need to be. The story of introducing or reminding you of the concept of the function is because a function is a really interesting mapping for mathematics that says from this value of the input, the independent variable, you have only one number in a scalar function. So at this moment in time, the temperature here is probably 22 degrees, only one. And so the independent variables could be one or more; if it's the plane of an image it could be x and y, if it's time it's one. And if the function is not scalar but it's a vector function, maybe at this moment in time I'm getting the oxygen concentration, the temperature, and the heartbeats. So it might be multiple, might have multiple dimensions. Something that... all concepts... this has been discussed in mathematics 1000 years ago, so they were useful even before inventing any device to measure these signals.

These are known functions, mathematical analytical functions like the exponential or a sinusoid. By the way, if time is measured in seconds, what is the frequency of the sinusoid? You know? Or the period? I wrote it in this way because for many years at the university people told me about sinusoids, sine and cosine. Okay, but if I want the sine of 20 Hertz, how do I write it? So T is in seconds and you probably know that inside this function, things have to be without physical dimensions. Well okay, yeah, pi is in radians but it's not really a physical dimension. So here inside, a physical unit cannot survive. It cannot be time. I don't know what the sine of 23 seconds is. It's like an exponential of three apples—it doesn't make sense. I don't know. So this 0.1 is the value of the frequency, it's 0.1 Hertz, which is 100... so it's one... so it's 10 milliseconds... so sorry, 100 milliseconds. Anyway, this collection of data points might also be collected in a file on a disk or on paper or on an oscilloscope. It does not require to be described analytically by a mathematical function. And so these are some examples of scalar functions, like electromyography, that maybe is the only thing that will work. I will try to see whether I can get electrical activity in this muscle. Music, so a voice recorded, now it only has one channel, it's not right or left, it's not stereo, so at every moment in time I'm basically sending via Bluetooth just one number that is the intensity of the sound. A black and white photo is another scalar example of a signal because you have two independent variables, but for each x and y you have one value that is the brightness, the gray level. If it's black and white, it is only one level. And there are other examples. So if it's a vector function, it might be some sort of observable of a fly that is moving around, and at every moment in time, I can measure the instantaneous velocity. And the instantaneous velocity might be a vector, talking about some direction, some intensity, and some *verso*. So, some direction and intensity. So, it's vectors, you know, that might be described by three numbers in a Cartesian system. So, for every moment in time, I have three numbers. That's the meaning of a vector, sorry, a vector signal.

#### **Section 3: The Historical Roots of Electrophysiology**

Now for the specific case of electrophysiological signals, it's very interesting and intriguing. I don't know whether you have watched this silly little talk that I gave a few years ago at a science festival. We owe it to... so the entire field of electronic engineering, of electricity, of electromagnetism is actually due to people who embarked on measuring electrical phenomena in biological systems, which I find surprising. And probably you know that these two guys, two Italians, were considered the fathers, the pioneers, and particularly Galvani was the one that just by chance found that there must have been some sort of "animal electricity," because when he touched the nerve of a resected leg of a frog with a metal, then the frog's muscle contracted. So it seems to be... well, it must be some electricity. Now Galvani, unfortunately, got it wrong in one interpretation because he thought that it's a fluid, it's the animal fluid. It's not the same phenomenon that Alessandro Volta, they were more or less contemporaries, was studying in a different lab. He said, "No, this has nothing to do with metaphysics or with some animal principle." It's the exact same electricity that this guy, Volta, got by, inspired by Galvani, placing different metals together. It's the same electricity. And so, but they were anyway giants, despite this rivalry and despite the... yeah, despite that Galvani got it wrong. And he actually died in bad conditions, depressed and convinced that he was, he had been a failure. He was not. So this is a stupid movie to show that by sort of closing the circuit and applying some sort of electricity or metal, the leg of the frog was indeed contracting. And these are the starting observations. So spasms, so mechanical contractions, muscle contractions—today I should maybe call it cellular excitability, but we will see later what this is—is characterizing biological systems, particularly muscles and not only muscle tissue but also cardiac tissue, pancreatic, some pancreatic cells, nerve cells of course. They're all cells that would react if you would be given some electricity. And particularly the story was originally from different metals that were in touch with the... and so creating some sort of difference of electrostatic potential or electric field. I will review during next week's class some elementary concepts of electromagnetism such as electrostatic potentials, electric fields, Coulomb forces, so don't worry too much about that physics. And the interesting thing is that passing a current through the leg was creating a visible reaction, so much so that they would be measuring the speed of propagation. And as if you watch this video, this talk of mine, it basically... they invented neurophysiology. So it's not only them, it's people following, and they were in a... you know, historically, in a situation where people were still convinced that there was some sort of metaphysical principle in living organisms. And so the brain had this "animal electricity," "animal principle," "animal fluid" that was not knowable. So it could not be understood or measured, it was metaphysical, so it could not be measured. And people said, particularly people like Helmholtz or others, they were convinced that it was understandable by the laws of physics and chemistry, and they proved it. And they started a field that bioengineering is somehow building on today.

So I will stop and then we'll start later. So the question is that, I'll tell you what I will show you and then... so it will be... the question is that I will also have some electrical signals and it's just to entertain you and to make this four-hour class a little bit less heavy. And do you know Murphy's Law? So, of course, as I said, something that could go wrong, did go wrong. This is Murphy's Law. And apparently, I read yesterday that the guy was serious in the sense that he was basically, it was not only just a joke, he was actually saying, in engineering, it's guaranteed that things will fail. So, do organize so that things are not failing. In this particular case, it fails or it will fail, first of all, because I had a last-minute burnout. And secondly, in this environment, the noise is too large. I don't have a Faraday cage that would shield the noise, particularly this damn 50 Hertz noise, which is related to the power, to the alternating current that is in the power outlet. So also here. But even if I disconnect the laptop, it still will capture this very slow, oscillating electromagnetic interference, which is at 50 Hz. And we will see it immediately. And then there is also the ground loop that will prevent me from getting data. And I will use an electronic amplifier. I think that you are more than competent to understand that I need to amplify signals that are very, very tiny. I need to make them much stronger. It will not work if I plug my fingers in the input of this analog-to-digital converter. So the analog-to-digital converter, maybe you've heard, it will acquire analog signals. "Analog" because they are changing over time; they are signals that are changing in analogy to the physical quantities of the real world. And they will basically convert them to digital signals. Not only will they digitize them, but they will also sample them. I think that you might be all familiar with Nyquist. Do you know Nyquist? So anyway, he's one guy who made it very strict that in order to make signals usable on a computer, you cannot... with continuity, with temporal continuity... you need to observe it like with a stroboscopic flashing light at precise times, at precise moments in time. And the period is called the sampling period. And this guy here is sampling at... I will not tell you because it's one of the questions that I would like you to see... so a few hundred or a few thousand times per second. And I need an amplifier. But let me stop, otherwise I'll lose your attention. Let's break for 10 minutes and let's continue later. Thank you.

Yes? How are you? And this is for Teams but I think that you already have it or not? No, because in the university I have a lot of difficulty to start. Can't be yet, not yet, not yet, not yet. Okay. I thought I would ask if there was also a code. I said no, but it was just... Okay, thank you. Nothing. Correct, because we are going from here at 8:00. And in the middle of Mirandola? - But you have to write it if you can present it? - If you want to write it, then you can write it. - Yes, yes, absolutely. I don't know where it is, but it's in the center of the... and there should be a few halls. - No, with pleasure. If you are there, then it's... - If you have the fortune... - Okay. Maybe you can tell... Because in the center of the community there is not one bar, in a bar there is only a coffee machine and then... if you have a microphone it still works. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

#### **Section 4: Live EMG Demonstration**

So I'm a little bit disappointed because there is no noise. It's Murphy's Law in the opposite sense because it's working much better than at home. And there is no 50 Hertz noise. I wanted to show you this... no, well, it is noisy, but it's not the noise that I'm used to. So I will show you what... so I will tell you later the details of what I'm doing. And in the video recording, I'm using the webcam to show that I connected two electrodes to this part of my arm and the third electrode, which is the reference electrode—and I will tell you what this measurement is—I connected here below my... just a little bit below my left shoulder. And there is no noise. So I might attempt also the ECG, the electrocardiogram, also called EKG, but this one is called EMG. And so I am a frog in the sense that the electrodes are amplifying... I think the amplification is 100 times, and I'll tell you how in a moment. It is amplifying signals related to muscles. We know nothing about muscles, we will not study muscles per se, but you probably know that you don't have one big muscle, you have many fibers, and each fiber has its own electrical activity. So it's conceivable that if I do a voluntary contraction of the muscle... and by the way, I'm not able with this setup to look at nerve inputs. I could if I had a needle going in my skin. And in Zurich, when I told you that I attended a few courses during my PhD, there was one very charismatic professor that was putting a needle inside his own muscle, but I'm not that brave. And so what is now recording is something that is probably... I don't know what that pulse was. It could be an electrical artifact. I want to show you what happens if I simply try to contract my fist. And your criticism could be, "Wait, but if you move the electrodes, so if you apply movement, then you have artifacts." So you have to really... in order to convince you that what we are measuring is maybe related to the electrical activity of the living tissue, I have to try to see whether I can stay very still. And the difference will be striking. You will see when I contract, you will see that the variance will increase. It's the crucial moment, come on. Now take your time, I'm joking. But it is the crucial time. So all of these are artifacts probably because I'm moving and it's probably the wires, even the wires. But look what happens when I contract my fist. So I'm not moving, I'm just... those of you who are maybe more expert than I am would probably call this an isometric contraction, so I'm not moving any... correct me if I'm wrong, maybe it's not isometric. And as I keep it contracted, you actually see this increased variance and it seems that there are several oscillations. I just release and it goes away. I contract and I release. I contract and I release. I'm very proud that this works. I would say it took hours to do that. That's it. I wanted only to show that I can maybe zoom in, changing the scale, the vertical scale... that it's not going smaller than 20 millivolts per division, but what I can change is the time base, so how much time is per division by those squares. I can go much faster on a time base that is faster. And here you will actually see that the signal seems to have primitives that are not arbitrarily fast. It's not white noise, it's not arbitrarily going up and down. It seems to have some sort of dynamics of signals that are going up and down within a few tens of milliseconds. Each square is 50 milliseconds. Thank you.

### **Part 4: Future Directions: Computation and Bio-Hybrid Systems**

#### **Section 1: The Bionic Dream and Sensory Prosthetics**

...will be... you have to read the lips but okay, today is blah blah, you have seen it and I will try to find a way, presumably leaving the audio from the laptop and not having this one, so this is better and the audio will be a little bit lower quality but will not stop. I apologize, I charged it this morning but probably they cannot withstand three hours or four hours of class.

Okay, so... so even myself, I was particularly drawn to bioengineering or to the study of the brain for the same reason. In the 80s when I was a kid, there were ugly TV series like this one that was called *The Bionic Man*. It was an Air Force pilot that had a severe accident and because of the injuries, but he was so precious, the Secret Service said, "We can rebuild him." And they were actually replacing his visual cortex with an artificial eye, the arm that was amputated with a robotic arm that gave him super... like a fantastic force, the guy was... and particularly what was interesting is that they had an artificial eye connected to an artificial cortex. And okay, the legs, the limbs were trivial, okay, fine, you have robotic limbs, but it's okay. And then the guy was able to run at superhuman speeds. The funny thing is that they did the spin-off series, *The Bionic Woman*. Okay, this guy's title was *The Six Million Dollar Man*. It's ridiculous, particularly with today's exchange rate. The spin-off was *The Bionic Woman*, and they also had a mini-series on the bionic dog. It was fun.

So the story of being able to... we'll see later about motor prosthetics, but sensory prosthetics is another central point, and people over the past 50 years have made incredible progress. I don't remember, I think in November on Friday in Mirandola, we will host one guy working in Austria, in... I forgot the name of the city, it's not far from the border in Alto Adige. Okay, doesn't matter, and he works in a company that is doing cochlear prosthetics, cochlear implants, and making it possible for deaf patients to hear again. And here it seems to be a relatively easy problem because the cochlea is shaped like a *chiocciola*, from the animal, and it is related to the anatomy of one part of the auditory system, the periphery of the auditory system. And it is special because nature evolved it in a way that if you are able to unroll it—it's all wrapped on itself—but if you are able to make it a line, you have some sensory cells that have mechanical cilia, and these cilia are long or short depending on if you are in one spot of the cochlea or another. And you can probably guess that the longer or the shorter you are, you will change the resonance frequency if these things are sort of in touch with mechanical vibrations due to auditory sounds. So we have the tympanum and we have some liquid system and ultimately we have mechanical vibrations from the air related to these cilia. And depending on their length, they are able to perform as filters. They would not resonate... so the very short ones will not start to oscillate for my pitch of voice, but they would if, say, somebody would start speaking with a very high pitch, and they would because in that case, the frequency of the mechanical oscillation will be higher. You probably know that... okay, you don't anymore... you're not fond of house music, it's a different generation, so I don't know what you do when... when you don't go to the disco, but there it's very low frequencies, very low bass sounds, and in order to resonate, being an existing relationship between frequency and wavelength, you need long oscillating rods or cilia to detect and to oscillate, so to filter out this signal. So here you have what is called a tonotopic organization. So it's "topic" meaning there is some place, a placement that is mapping tones, which is very surprising. You have, say, violins here and the bass drums of house music or whatever you hear today at the other extreme. So it's conceivable that if you have not just one electrode like in DBS, deep brain stimulation, but if you have an array of electrodes in a way, because you may want to stimulate different spots, maybe you can process my voice, decompose it by Fourier transform into fundamental frequencies and stimulate different electrodes electrically depending on where they are. And of course, since the cochlea is not straight, you may design your electrode array in a way that is flexible and it's also kind of resembling the anatomical structure. So and it will be roughly being able to replace the nerve cells, the sensory neurons that are no longer working. So you don't have this... well, they might still be there, but they don't work anymore. And if you stimulate here, the underlying neuronal circuitry would still be expecting to get activated, because they would expect these guys physiologically to get activated when the frequencies are bass sounds, instead of the other ones from the other extreme, violins.

And the result is surprising, and there have been so many advances in signal processing to make it possible to learn or to adapt the way that sounds are processed in order to be converted into a frequency domain stimulation. And as you can imagine, now I'm making it as if we know how to electrically stimulate nerve cells. Maybe this is a sort of very tiny electroshock, like it is the electroshock here. I'm just exaggerating, it's not an electroshock, they're very, very tiny currents, but it is as if I'm blasting a very loud sound at you, expecting that you will answer a question. You are neurons, the question would be answered by emitting, say, some sort of encoded signal by having an action potential like this or like that, and I shout, and you probably are responding something, but first of all, I'm not able to speak to one cell at a time. I shout, all of you hear me, and maybe I traumatize you. You are shouting back, you are startled, and you are shouting back. So we are far from being able to talk to neurons. The story that I mentioned before, using light and optogenetics, is a more elegant thing, because not only can you shout, you can excite, but you can also silence, something that you cannot do with electrical stimulation.

The same concept has been explored for retinal prosthetics, where instead of having just a monodimensional array, you have a bidimensional array, like a fakir's bed. Have you ever seen an image of a fakir? *Un fachiro, un letto da fachiro*. In India, there were people, if you Google it, you will see people sitting on a bed of nails. So a bed, not with a mattress, but with a lot of individual nails. It's a comparison that I do very often. And it's sort of similar to what, in this case... this is not to be implanted in the eye of a patient, but in this case, it's an array... take a look and pass it around... it's a bidimensional array of microelectrodes. It's so tiny, made with CMOS technology, that you can't see it with the naked eye. And the green stuff that you see around is a printed circuit board, and it has a lot of contacts, and you can individually activate different electrodes in the retina. So here, a surgical operation is inserting this array of different electrodes on the floor of the retina. And if you have a camera mounted on glasses, you could maybe transfer by inductive coupling images processed on the camera to electrical pulses in the retina. And the guy is, of course, smiling because it was a promotional video from the company. But I think, if I'm not mistaken, this is the guy, or it's a different guy. This is the guy being able to see the moon again.

In the cochlea, I told you about tonotopy, so a tonotopic organization. In the retina, you have a retinotopic organization. So, points that are nearby in the world, just because of the optical properties of the lens, are projected... the light is projected to a nearby point in the plane of the retina. And so, if you stimulate nearby cells in the retina, technically they are called ganglion cells, then you are presumably eliciting some sensation, what are called phosphenes, of sensory stimulation. A blind person will actually see two small lights, two pixels, lighting up, and they will also be close by in the perception of the patient. So the concept is very simple and it's basically the same as a cochlear prosthetic device. Here, you stimulate depending on an image. Maybe the image was pixelated. And so if you stimulate different pixels, for instance, there is a light there that I see, and then there is darkness here, or vice versa. Here I see that it is bright, and here it is darker. I can stimulate a little bit stronger on the left, and then on the right, I stimulate less to give the same transition between bright and dark.

Something very interesting is that this company decided at some point, for reasons that are related to the market, which is another very interesting component that I hope can be discussed again on Friday, one of the Fridays of these colloquia in bioengineering at the end of December, middle of December. The last one will be one person that was responsible for these implants in Italy, and basically, they decided that it was not worth it. And to me, that is amazing. So, of course, I'm not motivated by and I'm not working in a professional, non-academic context, but to think that you, from one day to the next, you decide, "Look, the specific disease that these guys were suffering, Retinitis Pigmentosa, affects... it's a genetic disorder, it's a degenerative disorder related to a genetic condition, is only affecting a small number of people. So, there is no business." So, I don't know who was to make money. In reality, you could get... problems for making money. Because you would restore vision in blind people, which is amazing. I mean, isn't it the dream of everyone? Or you would be able to make a sort of artificial arm for an amputee patient. But then at least this was the situation about 10-15 years ago and Professor Silvestro Micera, I hope he will answer this question. We ran a project, a European project, and in this project, there was a big company called Otto Bock. It's a multinational but has its headquarters in Germany, and we were actually having them on board in this consortium of universities and partners. And they told me very clearly, "Fine, you can do whatever,"—at least 10 years ago, I don't know now if things are different—"you can do whatever robotic arm that you want, you can make a fantastic electrode-neuron or nerve cell or axon coupling as advanced as you want. I'm not going to sell it. I'm not going to sell it for you because health insurance in different countries will not pay for the robotic arms." The only thing that they would cover—again maybe this is different, it was like this 15 years ago—what they would cover is passive prosthetic things made of silicon that maybe have the possibility for a patient to, just with the other hand, contract it so that... so not something like in the *Star Wars* movie that would become independent, so you could control it by thought. And this was a very big surprise here. They decided that they didn't have a market, and this article says that the company withdrew, and there are still people with this device implanted. And it is like when a company, say, if Apple would go bankrupt, we would have computers and things for maybe a few more years, and then there would be no spare parts and no new computers. What they did, they did not go bankrupt; I think that they are focusing on a different approach that is more rewarding financially. That is, I'm not targeting only blind people because of that specific disorder of the retina, that can be Retinitis Pigmentosa, but also maculopathy, degenerative maculopathy. It's a very specific thing in the periphery, and maybe that's the reason why it worked nicely, because it's so simple. In the periphery, it works nicely. If you go higher in a hierarchy, it might be more complicated. I might be able, perhaps, to understand how to interface some sort of amplifier to the computer because I'm connecting via USB. It's a stupid comparison. I might have a hard time opening my computer and just operating on the motherboard. It would be a mess. It's so complicated. I don't have the schematics.

And here the idea is that they want to stimulate in the visual cortex. So even people that have, maybe they were born without eyes, they have a visual cortex. Okay, it will be more complicated, but they could receive this stimulator. So they would have glasses, and the glasses with the camera would transmit information directly to the visual cortex. How and where to stimulate in the cortex? Good luck. And particularly, so technology in terms of hardware, can be very advanced. Here you see another company... so this is, sorry, it's another company... it's a, if I remember correctly, it's an Illinois technology university. It's so small and this array of electrodes is even long, so they are not just like the one that you see, planar, that I'm circulating. These are able to go intracortically, they go inside the tissue, they don't stay in what is called subdural, so below the dura mater. That's a way to possibly stimulate different spots in the visual cortex electrically and obtain some sort of images, counting on the fact that you have retinotopy not only in the retina but you have it also in the visual cortex. The problem is that we don't know how to stimulate, what is the code. And another reason is that you may not want to electrically stimulate in a tissue that is excitable because if you stimulate a little bit too much, people could have a seizure, an epileptic seizure. And they, and patients had epileptic seizures during the clinical trial. Maybe it's easy because you basically stop stimulating, but the brain is a highly excitable tissue, so if you stimulate a little bit too much, then you have the entire cortex that goes nuts. So there are pros and cons.

Another thing that I invite you to think of is that if you have a camera in the frame of your glasses, and you're blind, okay, so you're blind, anything would work. You can no longer count on saccadic movement. Saccades are the rapid movements that we can do with our eyes, and you don't. Well, you could do that, but you don't have a functioning retina. So what you have to do is you have to move your head. And your brain is not used to moving the head while keeping the eyes straight. The eyes, particularly in a blind patient, would be constantly moving. And there are physiological mechanisms that are compensating for the fact that even if my eyes are moving, my perception is of a stable room. And even if I can move my head, there is a corollary compensation mechanism. Thank you. Thanks a lot. So this is also something that is worth devoting some thought to, because it's not trivial at all.

#### **Section 2: Motor Prosthetics and Brain-Computer Interfaces**

Let me move to motor prosthetics. Do you know this guy? Do you like him? I don't like him particularly, for many, many reasons. One thing is that he founded a company, Neuralink, and he started saying, this was several years ago, starting saying, "Neuroscience is over, we only need bioengineers." Okay, that would be good for you, but neuroscience is not solved. We don't know exactly how to make sense of electrophysiological signals. We know a little bit. And Neuralink made very big statements, promising, "We treat all diseases. Not only this, everybody will have, like in science fiction movies, *The Matrix* or *Johnny Mnemonic* and others, people will have a connect... well not necessarily a connector in the back of their head, but they will be able to interact with computers just with their brain, just by Bluetooth." And I don't know whether this is going to be the case, whether, yeah, you could maybe make sense of signals in my motor cortex if I'm a tetraplegic patient, and you can maybe decode if I had the arm, whether I would move it to the right or to the left. Maybe this you can decode, you can make sense of it, but forget about the complex multiple degrees of freedom. I don't remember how many degrees of freedom my hand has. It's probably about 20, 25, of that order of magnitude. And yeah, it's very complicated and we don't understand the motor system so well to say... "Of course, the guy is doing some... so I avoid that... so of course, this is encoding, we can decode his or her thoughts." Bold statement. And they also claimed that they were the first to have, last year, the first human implant. No, it's 20 years that people have done that in humans, even wirelessly. True, Musk, together with Apple, together with Samsung, they have access to amazing technology that would make it possible to do these things. This is just at the level of university consortia that don't have access to clean rooms where microchips are fabricated. And you know how small mobile phones have become. They have state-of-the-art hardware, but they don't yet have state-of-the-art neuroscience, because neuroscience is tough and it cannot necessarily be solved by injecting billions of euros or dollars.

So this is there, it was January last year. The problem is that by looking at specific parts of the brain in the motor cortex, a tetraplegic, paralyzed patient would have been able to use a cursor on a screen. By having electrodes connected to Bluetooth hardware, these are the electrodes that are implanted. So they are soft and they are not implanted by, like in some neurosurgical operations for deep brain stimulation, but they are implanted by a surgeon robot. I hope that it comes... It doesn't come. It's not this video. And of course, they call this telepathy, the first device. And I'm pissed off because this is clearly creating false illusions in patients. Sometimes, it doesn't happen so often, I have people writing via email saying, I've seen... so laypeople, so private citizens, writing to me and saying, "I've seen that you published this paper, could I bring you my mom that is suffering from Alzheimer's or from dementia?" No, I have no way to do it. Maybe what I do will make sense in 10, 20, 50 years. Instead, this guy is calling it telepathy, saying we cure all diseases.

So, I think it's this one. And in a moment, you will see that these electrodes are implanted. This is very cool, implanted by a robot surgeon that is able to avoid hitting the blood vessels and thereby avoiding causing a hemorrhage. This is very cool and it's done by infrared illumination. Blood will actually... fine, it's wireless so you actually don't see it in these animals, and you can record and stream via Bluetooth tens or hundreds of channels, and each dot is a nerve impulse detected in the sensory area of the animals. Here it's in the motor areas of the animal, and what you actually see... what you actually see... why? I need one of these. So what you actually see is there are markers. They could be stickers placed on a specific place of the limbs or by, say, image classification algorithms, if you want deep learning algorithms, but it doesn't matter, you can process a video, extracting at every single moment where the location of specific points is. And the algorithms are so smart that they could follow across frames in the video where my, say, my knee is in different frames. So if you do that you could plot the angle or the position as a function of time. And here the animal is not paralyzed; the animal is walking on this treadmill. And at the same time, you're recording in the motor cortex in the area that you know is responsible for controlling locomotion, and particularly the articulation of all those degrees of freedom. So you have the ground truth and you have the signal that you know contains that information. And so you build a neural classifier by learning, by training, and you compare it and you say, "Look how cool it is." It is cool that you can predict with high accuracy—so the continuous line is the actual position and the gray, the lighter line is the decoded signal from the brain. It is fantastic. But do this for a patient that is completely paralyzed. You cannot ask, "Okay, can you do a few hours of video walking because I need to... or moving your hand because I need to train my algorithm." And you know that machine learning is successful because it is now fed with huge, large datasets. If you have no dataset at all, it might be more complicated. Let me run it again.

So here you could decode a paralyzed patient. In this case, it's a motor action of the limbs of the animal. It's not particularly relevant or crucial, but it's a fantastic proof of concept. And in a moment you will probably see not only reading, but writing. When you see those bulbs, those cells, lighting up, it's because one particular electrode has been electrically activated. And one thing that you notice is that we are very far, even with Elon Musk, we are very far from the dream of playing the piano keyboard. Imagine that you hear, I don't know, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, and you say, "Okay, fine, now I would like to replicate it and I have a piano keyboard." Maybe you will never be able to replicate it exactly unless you are a very good musician, but at least you would like to press the piano buttons, the neurons, one at a time. You don't want to just go there with your elbow and press five or six keys of the piano keyboard. Here, you stimulate and you have a bunch of cells that are lighting up. It doesn't matter why they are bright. And this is, again, it's only a demonstration. So all these retinal prosthetics or cochlear prosthetics, sensory prosthetics, they are far from saying, "Oh, look, there is a small fly there and it's now changing direction, I know how..." We are very far even from the point of just the means of electrically eliciting a nerve impulse when we want. And this is the comparison with a keyboard, with a piano keyboard.

And at the same time, again repeating an experiment that was done 20 years earlier, here is the monkey. The motor cortex is again fed into an artificial... to a machine learning algorithm, and it's playing Pong. Pong from the 1970s, I remember it, it was the first video game. And the animal is not having a joystick; it's a small tube where it gets the reward. And so if you're a patient that is paralyzed... Wait a second, let me show you this. This was in 2012. If you're a tetraplegic patient and you're paralyzed, it might be worth experimenting on animals. And this lady is controlling this two or three degrees of freedom with a connector. So it was 2012, it was not Bluetooth, it was with a wire. I'm just showing you all this because maybe I perceive that some of you were correctly, understandably annoyed by the animal experiments, yet this is the goal, it's not the animal per se.

So, motor prosthetics is not only a cursor on the screen but also this robotic arm. This is massive, it's just because it's convenient to use something, this robotic arm that is already available, it's a commercial platform. And I think here, 2008, so many years ago, a different concept would make a patient, a tetraplegic patient... now this patient unfortunately died for other reasons, he didn't die because of this implant, he died because he did not survive heart complications, I think. And he was using computers almost 20 years ago by his thoughts. He was replying to emails, and here it's simply a different concept. You have an array of microelectrodes, this is like a bed of nails, each can be controlled individually and you're listening to the electrical pulses. It was a question but I think I answered it already. If you could read thoughts, what would you do? And I think in all your introductions, there was the idea of using it for therapeutic applications, and particularly in the case of tetraplegic patients, basically restoring some form of movement. Again, if you can read the thoughts but you have AI or you have some classification algorithm, you could maybe hope to gain insight even if you don't know the code. Maybe you could train with a patient saying over and over: "Please do whatever you want, but think of, if you had your arm, moving it, say, north or south." And at the same time, I record the electrical activity. There are huge problems. When do I start recording? When does it make sense? Maybe I can ask the patient, "When I play a sound, you start doing it." But one thing is to see the monkey there. The monkey was just getting the reward and he was no longer acting on a joystick that was used before for training. But for the tetraplegic patient that is not moving, it's a big deal to infer what the neural control is because we don't understand thoughts. We understand why just a tiny bit of an area of the motor cortex is getting activated a little bit, and we think that we are capturing the movement, move to the right or move to the left. In reality, probably the motor cortex is maybe even planning the trajectory. Motor actions are complex. It's not just "I move right or move left." I control all degrees of freedom to get my actuator in one point. Only to overwhelm you with a situation of complexity.

Swiss and Belgian chocolate in the supermarket, we have the code. We don't have the code for the spike train that was measured a few years ago in our lab. We don't know what it means. It's a rate code, does it matter? Is it the frequency of this nerve impulse that tells about the information? It's also this, but it's also the exact timing of the nerve impulse. And how? We don't know. It depends on where. In your spinal cord, you have neurons that if you have one kilogram, they will start firing at one frequency. And if I add another kilogram, two kilograms, the number of spikes per second—spikes, I call them spikes because they look like needles, action potentials, nerve impulses—the frequency would double. So it would correlate with the weight. But this is in the periphery. Very, very evolutionarily simple compared to motor planning in a primate. By the way, I'm standing as an inverted pendulum, I'm still gesturing and I'm not falling on the ground. It needs to be more complicated. So we don't have the Morse code, the Rosetta Stone, to make the comparison, what is what. This, we don't have. And yet, I think it's in this video here, I'll emphasize that the monkey... so this is from a pioneer from Duke University many years ago in 2008. I think it's a combination of these two videos. The guy is on YouTube and he has many, many talks and it was particularly impressive because he said, he described the surprise that the monkey at some point... here it's controlling the cursor on the screen with the joystick. At some point, the researchers basically swap and they say, "Okay, now we've trained the machine learning algorithm and basically we'll disconnect the joystick." And as the monkey continued to perform the task, what was interesting is that at some point—and the guy has a very strong Brazilian accent that I won't try to imitate—but he says, "We realized that we were making history because the monkey realized that he was no longer touching the joystick." And again, this is amazing. So the monkey learned to use a tool just by thought, realizing that it was no longer the hand, it was something else in the motor cortex that was controlling it. I show it to you because it's from more than 20 years ago and yeah, somehow we did learn a lot about this.

#### **Section 3: The Limits of Current Computing and Neuromorphic Engineering**

Before closing, maybe I will give you at the next week... we'll finish a little bit. There is another very crucial perspective that is not therapeutic, it is more related to a novel paradigm for computation. You probably learned that the so-called... what is the name... Moore's Law of doubling the number of transistors on a chip is predictable, so every year or every five years, I don't remember, there is progress in integration and therefore miniaturization and therefore power consumption. Now Moore's Law is no longer... it's starting to fail because transistors are getting so small that we are hitting quantum mechanical effects. They don't work anymore because they are maybe one or two atoms and they are no longer behaving like classic physics. So at some point, forget about having iPhone 19, iPhone 20, iPhone 21. At some point, it's not going to work. We have to end up with what we have. So computer scientists would immediately rise up, maybe some of you as computer scientists would tell me, and that's why now you have architectures with multiple cores, because we are anticipating this. Fine. Multiple cores implies that you need to become proficient in parallel programming. And again, good luck, because it's a very hard field to make, to transform any algorithm to make it parallel. There is still no recipe, and it may be that some things could be made parallel but other things may not.

But the real problem, and I'll show you this... this is from a movie a few years ago, I don't even remember what the movie was. They built robots that were sentient, that were intelligent, and the guy was learning and was scared. Interesting, it was in a nice context of a, say, degraded area of the city, and the guy started bonding with criminals. It's fun. He looked for imitation from cartoons of the 80s or started painting. Yeah, so it was fun. So this is still a dream of building artificial systems. The problem is that we don't yet have an artificial system with the same performance as the human brain. For some aspects, we are even beyond. For image recognition, we are definitely beyond human capabilities. The culprit, however, is the huge amount of power that you need to not only train but to run this device. I get by with three watt-hours from eating something, and you are probably starving now because four hours with me are heavy. For ChatGPT, you have on the order of two gigawatts per hour, and it's very intensive. There was a paper, an article in the news just reinforcing this story of unsustainable development. So the cloud, I'm sorry for the computer scientists in the room if they consider that to be... it cannot be the solution, it's not sustainable, even if you have nuclear plants that you are producing, because you need maybe 20 years to build one. And resources on the planet are starting now to already be less than what we need to operate our own civilization. So it's simply unsustainable.

There is another problem: the more you integrate electronics on a chip, the more heat dissipation is required. And in fact, you can only run a data center that is very large, maybe as large as this room, and to cool it down, maybe, you probably know Microsoft and many other providers are doing this, they are kept underwater, just in the water, for having a heat sink, just to dissipate heat in a better way. I don't... I can... my brain and your brains are happy, there are blood vessels that are definitely dissipating heat.

There is a sort of direction where bioengineering is going, which basically is skipping the application on humans, and it's basically taking the mimicry that has been very successful in nature. Planes, although they have not been directly inspired by birds, I'm pretty sure they were motivated because people wanted to fly. So here, it's a little bit more similar, so it's way more accurate. There is a field of engineering called neuromorphic, in which the same artificial electronic devices, or maybe even quantum devices, or even spintronic devices, are used or engineered with principles that are exactly the ones of how signals in the brain operate. So much so that they are able to mimic. In the early 2000s, there was one paper that appeared in *Science* entitled "A silicon neuron." It was one electronic circuit made of CMOS that was behaving sort of indistinguishably—although this is a very big statement—from a biological neuron. And if some of you are fond of playing with Legos, it's conceivable that if my brain is a collection of simple elements assembled in a complex way, maybe I can build in electronics neuromorphic circuits, which are a complicated assembly of elementary systems that are behaving and consuming very little power, like the brain. For those of you who are fond of or competent in or have reminiscences of electronics, digital electronics, ChatGPT, von Neumann architectures, use transistors as switches. Switches, and they switch between zero and one, and you probably know that there is a huge power load when you switch. Neuromorphic engineers use transistors as analog devices in a regime that is called weak inversion, and another way to call it, to identify how they operate, is called sub-threshold. So they use them as analog devices, for instance, to compute exponentials in hardware. You don't need to write a program; you have one transistor that is per se behaving as an exponential. Similarly, in a nerve cell, we will see it, one protein that is called an ion channel, it's a protein that is interleaved into the membrane of a cell, that one is a component, it's a protein, and it's performing as an exponential function. So this one-to-one mapping is inspiring a lot. And this is one paper that was published a few days ago, or maybe today or yesterday, where a neuromorphic system involving not a von Neumann architecture, not deep learning, not backpropagation, not large language models, attention, etc., but involving spikes, is able to perform similarly to the visual system. I'll omit what this predictive coding and what this is about.

#### **Section 4: The Biological Inspiration for Artificial Intelligence**

So, before closing in five minutes, I would like to emphasize two things you may not be aware of, but a large fraction of, at least at the beginning, how artificial neural networks started, and in general artificial intelligence, but more specifically machine learning, has been inspired by biology. The famous perceptron was invented by psychologists that were aware of how neurons were performing, that they were sort of all-or-none units and they were maybe emitting an action potential if their inputs were reaching some sort of threshold. Now from that point onwards, things diverged, because even the promise of building a circuit... this was John Hopfield many years ago, he got the Nobel Prize last year, probably you should know who he is. I mean, he's very important. He is the person in the 80s responsible for the end of the winter of AI. Marvin Minsky and others in the 60s killed AI, saying a perceptron cannot solve the XOR problem, so it's crap. Today we know that it's not entirely crap, but also because we have a lot of data and we have a lot of computational power. And Hopfield was, however, expecting or anticipating that we would have been building devices, physical devices, even materials that would perform like brain circuits. In reality, we end up having PyTorch, which is a very... it's a Python library and it's used, or yeah, I think it's the one of reference. So we end up having software, which again, it's not a very good idea because of power consumption. So the possibility of continuing to look at biology to extract principles is very, very timely and very relevant, because still, my brain is performing a variety of tasks and I don't need to see all of the internet in order to start speaking in a language. Admittedly, they are useful, but it's not... the holy grail is not going to be the current artificial neural networks.

I won't tell you about Neo, the character in *The Matrix* that is learning Kung Fu, because we are uploading knowledge. Maybe, that would be fantastic, but we are not yet there. The guy is able to have his cortex reprogrammed. We're not there. The guy knows Kung Fu. And unfortunately, we are not there. So, Elon Musk, sorry, but yeah, it's a very nice dream. Maybe what you did, that for sure, you advanced the hardware part, the technological part, in such a way that we can maybe now, if you are able also to release it to researchers, to experimental labs, maybe we can tweak it, maybe we can use it. Because so far, the best that you could do is moving a cursor like people have been doing for over 20 years.

#### **Section 5: The Frontier of Organoids and Biological Computing**

I think I'll stop here. I only wanted to mention this. Some of you mentioned the possibility of having stem cells or biotechnology, some of you. Something that we are also starting to do in the lab, and it was in the news yesterday or three days ago on the BBC... So, some of you will know that it's possible from skin cells, also from embryonic cells, to take cells and differentiate them into nerve cells, to build what are called induced pluripotent stem cells, and then differentiate them into whatever you want. And it's possible to do it and build mini-brains, although it's wrong, we should not call them mini-brains, although they do, they are called organoids. There is a company, if you go on this website, FinalSpark, they have an interesting business model. They claim, which is also my view and also the dream of some projects that we started in the lab, that in 50 years we will not only have to charge our phone, we will also have to give it a drop of sugar, because inherently there will be some biological component, a hybrid component that would absorb much, much less power and would have maybe some neurons, some biological neuronal network processing information and working at the same time. If you go here you will actually see live signals that are very similar to what we got in the lab.

Thank you for your attention, see you next week.
