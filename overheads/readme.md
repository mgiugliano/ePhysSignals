# Course Overheads 

This folder contains the primary visual and technical materials (overheads/slides) used during each lecture for the **Electrophysiological Signals** module. 

## 📋 Overview

The PDFs archived here serve as a roadmap for our discussions. Each set of slides integrates mathematical formalisms with empirical evidence from seminal neuroscientific literature.

## 📂 Contents

The materials are organized by topic (matching the course progression), exactly as presented during contact hours.

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Neuroengineering & Historical Context
### Chapter 2: Biophysical Primitives of Ion Transport
### Chapter 3: The Cell Membrane as an Electrical Interface
### Chapter 4: Cellular Excitability & The Action Potential
### Chapter 5: Synaptic Transmission & Network Integration
### Chapter 6: Extracellular Fields & Cable Theory
### Chapter 7: Electrophysiological Signal Processing


## 🛠 Usage for Students

* **Pre-Lecture Reading**: It is highly recommended to skim the relevant overheads before class to familiarize yourself with the themes covered, the equations and formalism employed, and the nomenclature cited.
* **Derivations**: While the slides provide the "skeletal" structure of our mathematical derivations, the full step-by-step proofs may be further developed live on the chalkboard. Use these overheads as a reference for the final expressions and assumptions. You should be able to perform the derivation yourselves.
* **References**: Many slides contain citations to primary research papers and books. Students are encouraged to look up these sources to understand the experimental context behind the data shown.
