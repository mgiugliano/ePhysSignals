# Course Overheads 

This folder contains the primary visual and technical materials (overheads/slides) used during each lecture for the **Electrophysiological Signals** module. 

## 📋 Overview

The PDFs archived here serve as a roadmap for our discussions. Each set of slides integrates mathematical formalisms with empirical evidence from seminal neuroscientific literature.

## 📂 Contents

The materials are organized by topic (matching the course progression):

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Neuroengineering & Historical Context
* **The Bionic Dream:** Evolution of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs); sensory prosthetics (cochlear and retinal implants) vs. motor prosthetics.
* **Historical Foundations:** The Galvani-Volta debate and the discovery of "animal electricity."
* **Scaling and Interfacing:** The physical challenges of connecting macroscopic electrodes to microscopic neurons; the future of nanotechnology and neuromorphic engineering.

### Chapter 2: Biophysical Primitives of Ion Transport
* **Mathematical Foundations:** Review of differential equations, logarithms, and vector calculus (gradients/integrals).
* **Forces of Nature:** Comparative analysis of Gravitational and Electrostatic forces; Coulomb’s Law and the role of permittivity in aqueous media.
* **Dynamics in Solution:** Stokes' Law and ionic mobility; the concept of velocity saturation (terminal velocity) in viscous fluids.
* **Flux and Current:** Defining particle flux ($J$); the Nernst-Planck electrodiffusion framework (combining Drift and Diffusion).

### Chapter 3: The Cell Membrane as an Electrical Interface
* **Membrane Biophysics:** Structure of the phospholipid bilayer; the membrane as a biological capacitor (specific capacitance $c_m \approx 1 \text{ \mu F/cm}^2$).
* **Equivalent Circuit Models:** Modeling the resting membrane as a parallel RC circuit; ionic "leak" channels as resistors.
* **Thermodynamic Equilibrium:** The Nernst Equation and the origin of the resting membrane potential (typically $-70 \text{ mV}$).
* **Steady-State Dynamics:** The Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation and the role of selective permeability.

### Chapter 4: Cellular Excitability & The Action Potential
* **The Hodgkin-Huxley Formalism:** Quantitative modeling of voltage-gated $\text{Na}^+$ and $\text{K}^+$ conductances.
* **Gating Variables:** The kinetics of activation and inactivation ($m, h, n$ variables); the law of mass action applied to protein states.
* **Action Potential Mechanics:** Threshold behavior, depolarization upstroke, overshoot, and repolarization phases.
* **Stochasticity:** Single-channel recording (Patch-clamp) and Markov models of ion channel flickering.

### Chapter 5: Synaptic Transmission & Network Integration
* **Synaptic Mechanisms:** Electrical synapses (gap junctions) vs. chemical synapses (neurotransmitter release).
* **Kinetic Modeling:** Post-synaptic potentials (AMPA, NMDA, GABA receptors); spatial and temporal integration of inputs.
* **Synaptic Dynamics:** Short-term plasticity (facilitation and depression); models of vesicle depletion and recycling.

### Chapter 6: Extracellular Fields & Cable Theory
* **One-Dimensional Cable Theory:** Applying Lord Kelvin’s equations to dendrites and axons; length and time constants.
* **Origins of EEG/LFP:** The biophysics of volume conduction; pyramidal cells as current dipoles and the generation of Local Field Potentials.
* **Cognitive Mapping:** Receptive field properties (Hubel & Wiesel) and the spatial GPS system (Place cells and Grid cells).
* **Pathological Signals:** The biophysics of epilepsy and the transition to hypersynchrony.

### Chapter 7: Electrophysiological Signal Processing
* **Instrumentation


## 🛠 Usage for Students

* **Pre-Lecture Reading**: It is highly recommended to skim the relevant overheads before class to familiarize yourself with the themes covered, the equations and formalism employed, and the nomenclature cited.
* **Derivations**: While the slides provide the "skeletal" structure of our mathematical derivations, the full step-by-step proofs may be further developed live on the chalkboard. Use these overheads as a reference for the final expressions and assumptions. You should be able to perform the derivation yourselves.
* **References**: Many slides contain citations to primary research papers and books. Students are encouraged to look up these sources to understand the experimental context behind the data shown.
