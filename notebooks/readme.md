# Sample Jupyter notebooks (Python) - on Google Colab

Clicking on the button(s) below will launch the corresponding notebook on the "cloud" computing premises of Google. 
Nothing to install, nothing to configure: you will run Python scripts I wrote to demonstrate and teach you parts of 
the content of this course. Try it yourself! 

If you are *brave*, try to look at the code and change it. Explore! Play! Enjoy! You can easily create your own duplicates of each
notebook, and save them in your own Google Drive.

Each notebook is also provided to you as a file to download (see this folder). You can then use and modify them locally, with a
Jupyter installation on your PC, if this is what you want.

If you have never heard of "notebooks", watch this light and short (25 min) video tutorial.
