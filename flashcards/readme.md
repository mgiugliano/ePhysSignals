This repository includes a collection of digital flashcards designed to assist with your exam preparation. These cards utilize spaced repetition to help you memorize and understand the course material more efficiently.

## 1. Download and Install Anki

To use these flashcards, you must first install the Anki desktop application. It is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

1.  Navigate to the official Anki website: [https://apps.ankiweb.net/](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
2.  Download the installer appropriate for your operating system.
3.  Follow the standard installation prompts to complete the setup.
4.  (Optional) Create an **AnkiWeb** account if you wish to synchronize your progress between your computer and the mobile app (AnkiDroid on Android or AnkiMobile on iOS).

## 2. Locate the Flashcards

The flashcard decks, one for each major chapter of our course, are located in this folder. Look for files with the `.apkg` extension (e.g., `Course_Module_01.apkg`). 

1.  Download the `.apkg` files to your local machine.
2.  If you are downloading via GitHub, ensure you click on the specific file and select **Download** (or **View Raw**) to ensure the binary file is saved correctly.

## 3. Importing Decks into Anki

Once Anki is installed and you have the deck files locally, follow these steps to import them:

1.  Launch the **Anki** application.
2.  Click on **File** in the top menu bar and select **Import**.
3.  Alternatively, click the **Import File** button at the bottom of the main window.
4.  Select the `.apkg` file you downloaded from this repository.
5.  Anki will confirm how many cards were successfully imported. The deck will now appear in your main list.

## 4. Study Recommendations

* **Daily Review:** Spaced repetition works best when used daily. The algorithm will determine which cards you need to see based on your previous performance.
* **Active Recall:** When a question appears, try to formulate the answer in your mind or say it aloud before revealing the back of the card.
* **Critical Thinking:** As noted already, these cards were generated by an LLM. If you encounter an "hallucination" or a factual error, please flag the card or report it to MG so the master file can be updated.
